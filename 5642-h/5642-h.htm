    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; GANGOIL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just a fortnight before Christmas, 1871, a young man, twenty-four years of
      age, returned home to his dinner about eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening.
      He was married, and with him and his wife lived his wife&rsquo;s sister.
      At that somewhat late hour he walked in among the two young women, and
      another much older woman who was preparing the table for dinner. The wife
      and the wife&rsquo;s sister each had a child in her lap, the elder having
      seen some fifteen months of its existence, and the younger three months.
      &ldquo;He has been out since seven, and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s had
      a mouthful,&rdquo; the wife had just said. &ldquo;Oh, Harry, you must be
      half starved,&rdquo; she exclaimed, jumping up to greet him, and throwing
      her arm round his bare neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about whole melted,&rdquo; he said, as he kissed her.
      &ldquo;In the name of charity give me a nobbler. I did get a bit of damper
      and a pannikin of tea up at the German&rsquo;s hut; but I never was so hot
      or so thirsty in my life. We&rsquo;re going to have it in earnest this
      time. Old Bates says that when the gum leaves crackle, as they do now,
      before Christmas, there won&rsquo;t be a blade of grass by the end of
      February.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate Old Bates,&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;He always prophesies
      evil, and complains about his rations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows more about sheep than any man this side of the Mary,&rdquo;
      said her husband. From all this I trust the reader will understand that
      the Christmas to which he is introduced is not the Christmas with which he
      is intimate on this side of the equator&mdash;a Christmas of blazing fires
      in-doors, and of sleet arid snow and frost outside&mdash;but the Christmas
      of Australia, in which happy land the Christmas fires are apt to be
      lighted&mdash;or to light themselves&mdash;when they are by no means
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man who had just returned home had on a flannel shirt, a pair of
      mole-skin trowsers, and an old straw hat, battered nearly out of all
      shape. He had no coat, no waistcoat, no braces, and nothing round his
      neck. Round his waist there was a strap or belt, from the front of which
      hung a small pouch, and, behind, a knife in a case. And stuck into a loop
      in the belt, made for the purpose, there was a small brier-wood pipe. As
      he dashed his hat off, wiped his brow, and threw himself into a
      rocking-chair, he certainly was rough to look at, but by all who
      understood Australian life he would have been taken to be a gentleman. He
      was a young squatter, well known west of the Mary River, in Queensland.
      Harry Heathcote of Gangoil, who owned 30,000 sheep of his own, was a
      magistrate in those parts, and able to hold his own among his neighbors,
      whether rough or gentle; and some neighbors he had, very rough, who made
      it almost necessary that a man should be able to be rough also, on
      occasions, if he desired to live among them without injury. Heathcote of
      Gangoil could do all that. Men said of him that he was too imperious, too
      masterful, too much inclined to think that all things should be made to go
      as he would have them. Young as he was, he had been altogether his own
      master since he was of age&mdash;and not only his own master, but the
      master also of all with whom he was brought into contact from day to day.
      In his life he conversed but seldom with any but those who were dependent
      on him, nor had he done so for the last three years. At an age at which
      young men at home are still subject to pastors and masters, he had sprung
      at once into patriarchal power, and, being a man determined to thrive, had
      become laborious and thoughtful beyond his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Heathcote had been left an orphan, with a small fortune in money,
      when he was fourteen. For two years after that he had consented to remain
      quietly at school, but at sixteen he declared his purpose of emigrating.
      Boys less than himself in stature got above him at school, and he had not
      liked it. For a twelvemonth he was opposed by his guardian; but at the end
      of the year he was fitted forth for the colony. The guardian was not sorry
      to be quit of him, but prophesied that he would be home again before a
      year was over. The lad had not returned, and it was now a settled
      conviction among all who knew him that he would make or mar his fortune in
      the new land that he had chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall, well-made young fellow, with fair hair and a good-humored
      smile, but ever carrying in his countenance marks of what his enemies
      called pig-headedness, his acquaintances obstinacy, and those who loved
      him firmness. His acquaintances were, perhaps, right, for he certainly was
      obstinate. He would take no man&rsquo;s advice, he would submit himself to
      no man, and in the conduct of his own business preferred to trust to his
      own insight than to the experience of others. It would sometimes occur
      that he had to pay heavily for his obstinacy. But, on the other hand, the
      lessons which he learned he learned thoroughly. And he was kept right in
      his trade by his own indefatigable industry. That trade was the growth of
      wool. He was a breeder of sheep on a Queensland sheep-run, and his flocks
      ran far afield over a vast territory of which he was the only lord. His
      house was near the river Mary, and beyond the river his domain did not
      extend; but around him on his own side of the river he could ride for ten
      miles in each direction without getting off his own pastures. He was
      master, as far as his mastership went, of 120,000 acres&mdash;almost an
      English county&mdash;and it was the pride of his heart to put his foot off
      his own territory as seldom as possible. He sent his wool annually down to
      Brisbane, and received his stores, tea and sugar, flour and brandy, boots,
      clothes, tobacco, etc., once or twice a year from thence. But the traffic
      did not require his own presence at the city. So self-contained was the
      working of the establishment that he was never called away by his
      business, unless he went to see some lot of highly bred sheep which he
      might feel disposed to buy; and as for pleasure, it had come to be
      altogether beyond the purpose of his life to go in quest of that. When the
      work of the day was over, he would lie at his length upon rugs in the
      veranda, with a pipe in his mouth, while his wife sat over him reading a
      play of Shakspeare or the last novel that had come to them from England.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had married a fair girl, the orphan daughter of a bankrupt squatter
      whom he had met in Sydney, and had brought her and her sister into the
      Queensland bush with him. His wife idolized him. His sister-in-law, Kate
      Daly, loved him dearly&mdash;as she had cause to do, for he had proved
      himself to be a very brother to her; but she feared him also somewhat. The
      people about the Mary said that she was fairer and sweeter to look at even
      than the elder sister. Mrs. Heathcote was the taller of the two, and the
      larger-featured. She certainly was the higher in intellect, and the
      fittest to be the mistress of such an establishment as that at Gangoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had washed his hands and face, and had swallowed the very copious
      but weak allowance of brandy-and-water which his wife mixed for him, he
      took the eldest boy on his lap and fondled him. &ldquo;By George!&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;old fellow, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be a squatter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Harry?&rdquo; asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want him to break his heart every day of his
      life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you always breaking yours? I thought your heart was pretty well
      hardened now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man talks of his heart, you and Kate are thinking of loves
      and doves, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of loves and doves, Harry,&rdquo; said
      Kate. &ldquo;I was thinking how very hot it must have been to-day. We
      could only bear it in the veranda by keeping the blinds always wet. I don&rsquo;t
      wonder that you were troubled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That comes from heaven or Providence, or from something that one
      knows to be unassailable, and therefore one can put up with it. Even if
      one gets a sun-stroke one does not complain. The sun has a right to be
      there, and is no interloper, like a free-selector. I can&rsquo;t
      understand why free-selectors and mosquitoes should have been introduced
      into the arrangements of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose the poor must live somewheres, and &lsquo;squiters
      too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Growler, the old maid-servant, as she put a boiled
      leg of mutton on the table. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Harry, if you&rsquo;re
      hungered, there&rsquo;s something for you to eat in spite of the
      free-selectors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Growler,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;excuse me for saying
      that you jump to conclusions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jumping is pretty well-nigh done,&rdquo; said the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. I find that old people can jump quite as briskly as
      young. You have rebuked me under the impression that I was grudging
      something to the poor. Let me explain to you that a free-selector may be,
      and very often is, a rich man. He whom I had in my mind is not a poor man,
      though I won&rsquo;t swear but what he will be before a year is over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who you mean, Mr. Harry; you mean the Medlicots. A very nice
      gentleman is Mr. Medlicot, and a very nice old lady is Mrs. Medlicot. And
      a deal of good they&rsquo;re going to do, by all accounts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Growler, that will do,&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner consisted of a boiled leg of mutton, a large piece of roast
      beef, potatoes, onions, and an immense pot of tea. No glasses were even
      put upon the table. The two ladies had dressed for dinner, and were bright
      and pretty as they would have been in a country house at home; but Harry
      Heathcote had sat down just as he had entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are tired to death,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;when I
      see you eat your dinner like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t being tired, Mary; I&rsquo;m not particularly tired.
      But I must be off again in about an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out again to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On horseback?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How else? Old Bates and Mickey are in their saddles still. I don&rsquo;t
      want to have my fences burned as soon as they&rsquo;re put up. It&rsquo;s
      a ticklish thing to think that a spark of fire any where about the place
      might ruin me, and to know at the same time that every man about the run
      and every swagsman that passes along have matches in their pocket. There
      isn&rsquo;t a pipe lighted on Gangoil this time of the year that mightn&rsquo;t
      make a beggar of you and me. That&rsquo;s another reason why I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have the young un a squatter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;I declare I think that squatters have more trouble than any
      people in the world,&rdquo; said Kate Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Free-selectors have their own troubles too, Kate,&rdquo;
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be explained as we go on that Heathcote felt that he had received
      a great and peculiar grievance from the hands of one Medlicot, a stranger
      who had lately settled near him, and that this last remark referred to a
      somewhat favorable opinion which had been expressed about this stranger by
      the two ladies. It was a little unfair, as having been addressed specially
      to Kate, intending as it did to imply that Kate had better consider the
      matter well before she allowed her opinion of the stranger to become
      dangerously favorable; for in truth she had said no more than her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Medlicots&rsquo; troubles will never trouble me, Harry,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, Kate; nor mine either more than we can help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they do,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;They trouble me, and her too,
      very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s back should be broad enough to bear all that for
      himself,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I get ashamed of myself when I grumble,
      and yet one seems to be surly if one doesn&rsquo;t say what one&rsquo;s
      thinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll always tell me what you&rsquo;re thinking,
      dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I shall&mdash;till this fellow is old enough to be
      talked to, and to be made to bear the burden of his father&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that time, Harry, you will have got rich, and we shall all be in
      England, sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about being rich, but we shall have been
      free-selected off Gangoil.&mdash;Now, Mrs. Growler, we&rsquo;ve done
      dinner, and I&rsquo;ll have a pipe before I make another start. Is Jacko
      in the kitchen? Send him through to me on to the veranda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gangoil was decidedly in the bush&mdash;according to common Australian
      parlance, all sheep stations are in the bush, even though there should not
      be a tree or shrub within sight. They who live away from the towns live a
      &ldquo;bush life.&rdquo; Small towns, as they grow up, are called bush
      towns, as we talk of country towns. The &ldquo;bush,&rdquo; indeed, is the
      country generally. But the Heathcotes lived absolutely and actually in the
      bush. There are Australian pastures which consist of plains on which not a
      tree is to be seen for miles; but others are forests, so far extending
      that their limits are almost unknown. Gangoil was surrounded by forest, in
      some places so close as to be impervious to men and almost to animals in
      which the undergrowth was thick and tortuous and almost platted, through
      which no path could be made without an axe, but of which the greater
      portions were open, without any under-wood, between which the sheep could
      wander at their will, and men could ride, with a sparse surface of coarse
      grass, which after rain would be luxuriant, but in hot weather would be
      scorched down to the ground. At such times&mdash;and those times were by
      far the more common&mdash;a stranger would wonder where the sheep would
      find their feed. Immediately round the house, or station, as it was
      called, about one hundred acres had been cleared, or nearly cleared, with
      a few trees left here and there for ornament or shade. Further afield, but
      still round the home quarters, the trees had been destroyed, the run of
      the sap having been stopped by &ldquo;ringing&rdquo; the bark; but they
      still stood like troops of skeletons, and would stand, very ugly to look
      at, till they fell, in the course of nature, by reason of their own
      rottenness. There was a man always at work about the place&mdash;Boscobel
      he was called&mdash;whose sole business was to destroy the timber after
      this fashion, so that the air might get through to the grasses, and that
      the soil might be relieved from the burden of nurturing the forest trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      For miles around the domain was divided into paddocks, as they were there
      called; but these were so large that a stranger might wander in one of
      them for a day and never discover that he was inclosed. There were five or
      six paddocks on the Gangoil run, each of which comprised over ten thousand
      acres, and as all the land was undulating, and as the timber was around
      you every where, one paddock was exactly like another. The scenery in
      itself was fine, for the trees were often large, and here and there rocky
      knolls would crop up, and there were broken crevices in the ground; but it
      was all alike. A stranger would wonder that any one straying from the
      house should find his way back to it. There were sundry bush houses here
      and there, and the so-called road to the coast from the wide pastoral
      districts further west passed across the run; but these roads and tracks
      would travel hither and thither, new tracks being opened from time to time
      by the heavy wool drays and store wagons, as in wet weather the ruts on
      the old tracks would become insurmountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station itself was certainly very pretty. It consisted of a cluster of
      cottages, each of which possessed a ground-floor only. No such luxury as
      stairs was known at Gangoil. It stood about half a mile from the Mary
      River, on the edge of a creek which ran into it. The principal edifice,
      that in which the Heathcotes lived, contained only one sitting-room, and a
      bedroom on each side of it; but in truth there was another room, very
      spacious, in which the family really passed their time; and this was the
      veranda which ran along the front and two ends of the house. It was twelve
      feet broad, and, of course, of great length. Here was clustered the
      rocking-chairs, and sofas, and work-tables, and very often the cradle of
      the family. Here stood Mrs. Heathcote&rsquo;s sewing-machine, and here the
      master would sprawl at his length, while his wife, or his wife&rsquo;s
      sister, read to him. It was here, in fact, that they lived, having a
      parlor simply for their meals. Behind the main edifice there stood, each
      apart, various buildings, forming an irregular quadrangle. The kitchen
      came first, with a small adjacent chamber in which slept the Chinese
      man-cook, Sing Sing, as he had come to be called; then the cottage,
      consisting also of three rooms and a small veranda, in which lived Harry&rsquo;s
      superintendent, commonly known as Old Bates, a man who had been a squatter
      once himself, and having lost his all in bad times, now worked for a small
      salary. In the cottage two of the rooms were devoted to hospitality when,
      as was not unusual, guests, known or unknown, came that way; and here
      Harry himself would sleep, if the entertainment of other ladies crowded
      the best apartments. Then at the back of the quadrangle was the store,
      perhaps of all the buildings the most important. In here was kept a kind
      of shop, which was supposed, according to an obsolete rule, to be open for
      custom for half a day twice a week. The exigencies of the station did not
      allow of this regularity; but after some fashion the shop was maintained.
      Tea was to be bought there, and sugar, tobacco, and pickles, jam, nails,
      boots, hats, flannel shirrs, and mole-skin trowsers. Any body who came
      might buy, but the intention was to provide the station hands, who would
      otherwise have had to go or send thirty miles for the supply of their
      wants. Very little money was taken here, generally none. But the quantity
      of pickles, jam, and tobacco sold was great. The men would consume large
      quantities of these bush delicacies, and the cost would be deducted from
      their wages. The tea and sugar, and flour also, were given out weekly, as
      rations&mdash;so much a week&mdash;and meat was supplied to them after the
      same fashion. For it was the duty of this young autocratic patriarch to
      find provisions for all who were employed around him. For such luxuries as
      jam and tobacco the men paid themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth side of the quadrangle was a rough coach-house, and rougher
      stables. The carriage part of the establishment consisted of two &ldquo;buggies&rdquo;&mdash;so
      called always in the bush&mdash;open carriages on four wheels, one of
      which was intended to hold two and the other four sitters. A Londoner
      looking at them would have declared them to be hopeless ruins; but Harry
      Heathcote still made wonderful journeys in them, taking care generally
      that the wheels were sound, and using ropes for the repair of
      dilapidations. The stables were almost unnecessary, as the horses, of
      which the supply at Gangoil was very large, roamed in the horse paddock, a
      comparatively small inclosure containing not above three or four hundred
      acres, and were driven up as they were wanted. One horse was always kept
      close at home with which to catch the others; but this horse, for
      handiness, was generally hitched to a post outside the kitchen door. Harry
      was proud of his horses, and was sometimes heard to say that few men in
      England had a lot of thirty at hand as he had, out of which so many would
      be able to carry a man eighty miles in eight hours at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice. But his stable arrangements would not have commanded respect in
      the &ldquo;Shires.&rdquo; The animals were never groomed, never fed, and
      many of them never shod. They lived upon grass, and, Harry always said,
      &ldquo;cut their own bread-and-butter for themselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gangoil was certainly very pretty. The veranda was covered in with striped
      blinds, so that when the sun shone hot, or when the rains fell heavily, or
      when the mosquitoes were more than usually troublesome, there might be
      something of the protection of an inclosed room. Up all the posts there
      were flowering creepers, which covered the front with greenery even when
      the flowers were wanting. From the front of the house down to the creek
      there was a pleasant failing garden&mdash;heart-breaking, indeed, in
      regard to vegetables, for the opossums always came first, and they who
      followed the opossums got but little. But the garden gave a pleasant
      home-like look to the place, and was very dear to Harry, who was, perhaps,
      indifferent in regard to pease and tomatoes. Harry Heathcote was very
      proud of the place, for he had made it all himself, having pulled down a
      wretched barrack that he had found there. But he was far prouder of his
      wool-shed, which he had also built, and which he regarded as first and
      foremost among wool-sheds in those parts. By-and-by we shall be called on
      to visit the wool-shed. Though Heathcote had done all this for Gangoil, it
      must be understood that the vast extent of territory over which his sheep
      ran was by no means his own property. He was simply the tenant of the
      Crown, paying a rent computed at so much a sheep. He had, indeed,
      purchased the ground on which his house stood, but this he had done simply
      to guard himself against other purchasers. These other purchasers were the
      bane of his existence, the one great sorrow which, as he said, broke his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was speaking, a rough-looking lad, about sixteen years of age,
      came through the parlor to the veranda, dressed very much like his master,
      but unwashed, uncombed, and with that wild look which falls upon those who
      wander about the Australian plains, living a nomad life. This was Jacko&mdash;so
      called, and no one knew him by any other name&mdash;a lad whom Heathcote
      had picked up about six months since, and who had become a favorite.
      &ldquo;The old woman says as you was wanting me?&rdquo; suggested Jacko.
      &ldquo;Going to be fine to-night, Jacko?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko went to the edge of the veranda and looked up to the sky. &ldquo;My
      word! little squall a-coming,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it would come from ten thousand buckets,&rdquo; said the
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No buckets at all,&rdquo; said Jacko. &ldquo;Want the horses,
      master?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I want the horses, and I want you to come with me. There
      are two horses saddled there; I&rsquo;ll ride Hamlet.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; A NIGHT&rsquo;S RIDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harry jumped from the ground, kissed his wife, called her &ldquo;old girl,&rdquo;
      and told her to be happy, and got on his horse at the garden gate. Both
      the ladies came off the veranda to see him start. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as
      dark as pitch,&rdquo; said Kate Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you have just come out of the light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is dark&mdash;quite dark. You won&rsquo;t be late, will you?&rdquo;
      said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be very early, as it&rsquo;s near ten now. I shall be
      back about twelve.&rdquo; So saying, he broke at once into a gallop, and
      vanished into the night, his young groom scampering after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he go out now?&rdquo; Kate said to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is afraid of fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t prevent the fires by riding about in the dark. I
      suppose the fires come from the heat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks they come from enemies, and he has heard something. One
      wretched man may do so much when every thing is dried to tinder. I do so
      wish it would rain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, in truth, was very dark. It was now midsummer, at which time
      with us the days are so long that the coming of the one almost catches the
      departure of its predecessor. But Gangoil was not far outside the tropics,
      and there were no long summer nights. The heat was intense; but there was
      a low soughing wind which seemed to moan among the trees without moving
      them. As they crossed the little home inclosure and the horse paddock, the
      track was just visible, the trees being dead and the spaces open. About
      half a mile from the house, while they were still in the horse paddock,
      Harry turned from the track, and Jacko, of course, turned with him.
      &ldquo;You can sit your horse jumping, Jacko?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! jump like glory,&rdquo; answered Jacko. He was soon tried.
      Harry rode at the bush fence&mdash;which was not, indeed, much of a fence,
      made of logs lengthways and crossways, about three feet and a half high&mdash;and
      went over it. Jacko followed him, rushing his horse at the leap, losing
      his seat and almost falling over the animal&rsquo;s shoulders as he came
      to the ground. &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; said Jacko, just saving himself by a
      scramble; &ldquo;who ever saw the like of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit in your saddle, you stupid young duffer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit in my saddle! Why don&rsquo;t he jump proper? Well, you go on.
      I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m a duffer. Duffer, indeed! My word!&rdquo;
      Heathcote had turned to the left, leaving the track, which was, indeed,
      the main road toward the nearest town and the coast, and was now pushing
      on through the forest with no pathway at all to guide him. To ordinary
      eyes the attempt to steer any course would have been hopeless. But an
      Australian squatter, if he have any well-grounded claim to the character
      of a bushman, has eyes which are not ordinary, and he has, probably,
      nurtured within himself, unconsciously, topographical instincts which are
      unintelligible to the inhabitants of cities. Harry, too, was near his own
      home, and went forward through the thick gloom without a doubt, Jacko
      following him faithfully. In about half an hour they came to another
      fence, but now it was too absolutely dark for jumping. Harry had not seen
      it till he was close to it, and then he pulled up his horse. &ldquo;My
      word! why don&rsquo;t you jump away, Mr. Harry? Who&rsquo;s a duffer now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, or I&rsquo;ll put my whip across your back. Get
      down and help me pull a log away. The horses couldn&rsquo;t see where to
      put their feet.&rdquo; Jacko did as he was bid, and worked hard, but still
      grumbled at having been called a duffer. The animals were quickly led
      over, the logs were replaced, and the two were again galloping through the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were making for the wool-shed,&rdquo; said Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re eight miles beyond the wool-shed,&rdquo; said Harry.
      They had now crossed another paddock, and had come to the extreme fence on
      the run. The Gangoil pastures extended much further, but in that direction
      had not as yet been inclosed. Here they both got off their horses and
      walked along the fence till they came to an opening, with a slip panel, or
      movable bars, which had been Heathcote&rsquo;s intended destination.
      &ldquo;Hold the horses, Jacko, till I come back,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko, when alone, nothing daunted by the darkness or solitude, seated
      himself on the top rail, took out a pipe, and struck a match. When the
      tobacco was ignited he dropped the match on the dry grass at his feet, and
      a little flame instantly sprang up. The boy waited a few seconds till the
      flames began to run, and then putting his feet together on the ground
      stamped out the incipient fire. &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; said Jacko to
      himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy done, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry went on to the left for about half a mile, and then stood leaning
      against the fence. It was very dark, but he was now looking over into an
      inclosure which had been altogether cleared of trees, and which, as he
      knew well, had been cultivated and was covered with sugar-canes. Where he
      stood he was not distant above a quarter of a mile from the river, and the
      field before him ran down to the banks. This was the selected land of
      Giles Medlicot&mdash;two years since a portion of his own run, which had
      now been purchased from the government&mdash;for the loss of which he had
      received and was entitled to receive no compensation. And the matter was
      made worse for him by the fact that the interloper had come between him
      and the river. But he was not standing here near midnight merely to
      exercise his wrath by straining his eyes through the darkness at his
      neighbor&rsquo;s crops. He put his finger into his mouth to wet it, and
      then held it up that he might discover which way the light breath of wind
      was coming. There was still the low moan to be heard continually through
      the forest, and yet not a leaf seemed to be moved. After a while he
      thought he caught a sound, and put his ear down to the ground. He
      distinctly heard a footstep, and rising up, walked quickly toward the spot
      whence the noise came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he said, as he saw the figure of a man
      standing on his side of the fence, and leaning against it, with a pipe in
      his month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; replied the man on the fence. &ldquo;My name is
      Medlicot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Medlicot, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Mr. Heathcote? Good-night, Mr. Heathcote. You are going
      about at a late hour of the night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to go about early and late; but I ain&rsquo;t later than
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m close at home,&rdquo; said Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, at any rate, on my own run,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say that I am trespassing?&rdquo; said the other;
      &ldquo;because I can very soon jump back over the fence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that at all, Mr. Medlicot; any body is welcome
      on my run, night or day, who knows how to behave himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m included in that list.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so; of course. Considering the state that every thing is in,
      and all the damage that a fire would do, I rather wish that people would
      be a little more careful about smoking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My canes, Mr. Heathcote, would burn quite as quickly as your grass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not only the grass. I&rsquo;ve a hundred miles of fencing on
      the run which is as dry as tinder, not to talk of the station and the
      wool-shed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t suffer from my neglect, Mr. Heathcote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have men about who mayn&rsquo;t be so careful. The wind, such
      as it is, is coming right across from your place. If there were light
      enough, I could show you three or four patches where there has been fire
      within half a mile of this spot. There was a log burning there for two or
      three days, not long ago, which was lighted by one of our men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a fortnight since. There was no heat then, and the men
      were boiling their kettle. I spoke about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A log like that, Mr. Medlicot, will burn for weeks sometimes. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you fairly what I&rsquo;m afraid of. There&rsquo;s a man with you
      whom I turned out of the shed last shearing, and I think he might put a
      match down&mdash;not by accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Nokes. As far as I know, he&rsquo;s a decent man. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t have me not employ a man just because you had dismissed
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; that is, I shouldn&rsquo;t think of dictating to you
      about such a thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, Mr. Heathcote, I suppose not. Nokes has got to earn his
      bread, though you did dismiss him. I don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s not
      as honest a man as you or I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, there&rsquo;s three of us very bad; that&rsquo;s all, Mr.
      Medlicot. Good-night; and if you&rsquo;ll trouble yourself to look after
      the ash of your tobacco it might be the saving of me and all I have.&rdquo;
      So saying, he turned round, and made his way back to the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot had placed himself on the fence during the interview, and he
      still kept his seat. Of course he was now thinking of the man who had just
      left him, whom he declared to himself to be an ignorant, prejudiced,
      ill-constituted cur. &ldquo;I believe in his heart he thinks that I&rsquo;m
      going to set fire to his run,&rdquo; he said, almost aloud. &ldquo;And
      because he grows wool he thinks himself above every body in the colony. He
      occupies thousands of acres, and employs three or four men. I till about
      two hundred, and maintain thirty families. But he is such a pig that he
      can&rsquo;t understand all that; and he thinks that I must be something
      low because I&rsquo;ve bought with my own money a bit of land which never
      belonged to him, and which he couldn&rsquo;t use.&rdquo; Such was the
      nature of Giles Medlicot&rsquo;s soliloquy as he sat swinging his legs,
      and still smoking his pipe, on the fence which divided his sugar-cane from
      the other young man&rsquo;s run.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harry Heathcote uttered his soliloquy also. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      swear that he wouldn&rsquo;t do it himself, after all;&rdquo; meaning that
      he almost suspected that Medlicot himself would be an incendiary. To him,
      in his way of thinking, a man who would take advantage of the law to buy a
      bit of another man&rsquo;s land&mdash;or become a free-selector, as the
      term goes&mdash;was a public enemy, and might be presumed capable of any
      iniquity. It was all very well for the girls&mdash;meaning his wife and
      sister-in-law&mdash;to tell him that Medlicot had the manners of a
      gentleman and had come of decent people. Women were always soft enough to
      be taken by soft hands, a good-looking face, and a decent coat. This
      Medlicot went about dressed like a man in the towns, exhibiting, as Harry
      thought, a contemptible, unmanly finery. Of what use was it to tell him
      that Medlicot was a gentleman? What Harry knew was that since Medlicot had
      come he had lost his sheep, that the heads of three or four had been found
      buried on Medlicot&rsquo;s side of his run, and that if he dismissed
      &ldquo;a hand,&rdquo; Medlicot employed him&mdash;a proceeding which, in
      Harry Heathcote&rsquo;s aristocratic and patriarchal views of life, was
      altogether ungentleman-like. How were the &ldquo;hands&rdquo; to be kept
      in their place if one employer of labor did not back up another?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been warned to be on his guard against fire. The warnings had
      hardly been implicit, but yet had come in a shape which made him unable to
      ignore them. Old Bates, whom he trusted implicitly, and who was a man of
      very few words, had told him to be on his guard. The German, at whose hut
      he had been in the morning, Karl Bender by name, and a servant of his own,
      had told him that there would be fire about before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should any one want to ruin me?&rdquo; Harry had asked. &ldquo;Did
      I ever wrong a man of a shilling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The German had learned to know his young master, had made his way through
      the crust of his master&rsquo;s character, and was prepared to be faithful
      at all points&mdash;though he too could have quarreled and have avenged
      himself had it not chanced that he had come to the point of loving instead
      of hating his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like too much to be governor over all,&rdquo; said the German,
      as he stooped over the fire in his own hut in his anxiety to boil the
      water for Heathcote&rsquo;s tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody must be governor, or every thing would go to the devil,&rdquo;
      said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s true&mdash;only fellows don&rsquo;t like be made feel
      it,&rdquo; said the German, &ldquo;Nokes, he was made feel it when you put
      him over de gate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither would Bates nor the German express absolute suspicion of any
      man. That Medlicot&rsquo;s &ldquo;hands&rdquo; at the sugar-mill were
      stealing his sheep Harry thought that he knew; but that was comparatively
      a small affair, and he would not have pressed it, as he was without
      absolute evidence. And even he had a feeling that it would be unwise to
      increase the anger felt against himself&mdash;at any rate, during the
      present heats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko had his pipe still alight when Heathcote returned. &ldquo;You young
      monkey,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you been using matches?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Mr. Harry? Don&rsquo;t the grass burn ready, Mr. Harry? My
      word!&rdquo; Then Jacko stooped down, lit another match, and showed
      Heathcote the burned patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it so when we came?&rdquo; Harry asked, with emotion. Jacko,
      still kneeling on the ground, and holding the lighted match in his hand,
      shook his head and tapped his breast, indicating that he had burned the
      grass. &ldquo;You dropped the match by accident?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! no. Did it o&rsquo; purpose to see. It&rsquo;s all just
      one as gunpowder, Mr. Harry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry got on his horse without a word, and rode away through the forest,
      taking a direction different from that by which he had come, and the boy
      followed him. He was by no means certain that this young fellow might not
      turn against him; but it had been a part of his theory to make no
      difference to any man because of such fears. If he could make the men
      around him respect him, then they would treat him well; but they could
      never be brought to respect him by flattery. He was very nearly right in
      his views of men, and would have been right altogether could he have seen
      accurately what justice demanded for others as well as for himself. As far
      as the intention went, he was minded to be just to every man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, as they were riding, that the heat grew fiercer and fiercer.
      Though there was still the same moaning sound, there was not a breath of
      air. They had now got upon a track very well known to Heathcote, which led
      up from the river to the wool-shed, and so on to the station, and they had
      turned homeward. When they were near the wool-shed, suddenly there fell a
      heavy drop or two of rain. Harry stopped and turned his face upward, when,
      in a moment, the whole heavens above them and the forest around were
      illumined by a flash of lightning so near them that it made each of them
      start in his saddle, and made the horses shudder in every limb. Then came
      the roll of thunder immediately over their heads, and with the thunder
      rain so thick and fast that Harry&rsquo;s &ldquo;ten thousand buckets&rdquo;
      seemed to be emptied directly over their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God A&rsquo;mighty has put out the fires now,&rdquo; said Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry paused for a moment, feeling the rain through to his bones&mdash;for
      he had nothing on over his shirt&mdash;and rejoicing in it. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
      he said; &ldquo;we may go to bed for a week, and let the grass grow, and
      the creeks fill, and the earth cool. Half an hour like this over the whole
      run, and there won&rsquo;t be a dry stick on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went on, the horses splashed through the water. It seemed as
      though a deluge were falling, and that already the ground beneath their
      feet were becoming a lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might have too much of this, Jacko.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have the Mary flooded again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! no.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But by the time they reached the wool-shed it was over. From the first
      drop to the last, there had hardly been a space of twenty minutes. But
      there was a noise of waters as the little streams washed hither and
      thither to their destined courses and still the horses splashed, and still
      there was the feeling of an incipient deluge. When they reached the
      wool-shed, Harry again got off his horse, and Jacko, dismounting also,
      hitched the two animals to the post and followed his master into the
      building. Harry struck a wax match, and holding it up, strove to look
      round the building by the feeble light which it shed. It was a remarkable
      edifice, built in the shape of a great T, open at the sides, with a
      sharp-pitched timber roof covered with felt, which came down within four
      feet of the ground. It was calculated to hold about four hundred sheep at
      a time, and was divided into pens of various sizes, partitioned off for
      various purposes. If Harry Heathcote was sure of any thing, he was sure
      that his wool-shed was the best that had ever been built in this district.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jimini! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear any thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko pointed with his finger down the centre walk of the shed, and Harry,
      striking another match as he went, rushed forward. But the match was out
      as soon as ignited, and gave no glimmer of light. Nevertheless he saw, or
      thought that he saw, the figure of a man escaping out of the open end of
      the shed. The place itself was black as midnight, but the space beyond was
      clear of trees, and the darkness outside being a few shades lighter than
      within the building, allowed something of the outline of a figure to be
      visible. And as the man escaped, the sounds of his footsteps were audible
      enough. Harry called to him, but of course received no answer. Had he
      pursued him, he would have been obliged to cross sundry rails, which would
      have so delayed him as to give him no chance of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew there was a fellow about,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;one of our
      own men would not have run like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko shook his head, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got in here for shelter out of the rain, but he was doing no
      good about the place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko again shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder who he was?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko came up and whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Bill Nokes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seed the drag of his leg.&rdquo; Now it was well known that the man
      Nokes had injured some of his muscles, and habitually dragged one foot
      after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you could have been sure of him by such a
      glimpse as that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;only I&rsquo;m sure as sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Heathcote said not another word, but getting again upon his horse,
      galloped home. It was past one when he reached the station, but the two
      girls were waiting up for him, and at once began to condole with him
      because he was wet. &ldquo;Wet!&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;if you could
      only know how much I prefer things being wet to dry just at present! But
      give Jacko some supper. I must keep that young fellow in good humor if I
      can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Jacko had half a loaf of bread, and a small pot of jam, and a large jug
      of cold tea provided for him, in the enjoyment of which luxuries he did
      not seem to be in the least impeded by the fact that he was wet through to
      the skin. Harry Heathcote had another nobbler&mdash;being only the second
      in the day&mdash;and then went to bed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. &mdash; MEDLICOT&rsquo;S MILL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Harry said, they might all now lie in bed for a day or two. The rain
      had set aside for the time the necessity for that urgent watchfulness
      which kept all hands on the station hard at work during the great heat.
      There was not, generally, much rest during the year at Gangoil. Lambing in
      April and May, washing and shearing in September, October, and November,
      with the fear of fires and the necessary precautions in December and
      January, did not leave more than sufficient intervals for looking after
      the water-dams, making and mending fences, procuring stores, and attending
      to the ailments of the flocks. No man worked harder than the young
      squatter. But now there had suddenly come a day or two of rest&mdash;rest
      from work which was not of itself productive, but only remedial, and
      which, therefore, was not begrudged.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it soon was apparent that the rest could be only for a day or two. The
      rain had fallen as from ten thousand buckets, but it had fallen only for a
      space of minutes. On the following morning the thirsty earth had
      apparently swallowed all the flood. The water in the creek beneath the
      house stood two feet higher than it had done, and Harry, when he visited
      the dams round the run, found that they were fall to overflowing, and the
      grasses were already springing, so quick is the all but tropical growth of
      the country. They might be safe, perhaps, for eight-and-forty hours. Fire
      would run only when the ground was absolutely dry, and when every twig or
      leaf was a combustible. But during those eight-and-forty hours there might
      be comparative ease at Gangoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day following the night of the ride Mrs. Heathcote suggested to her
      husband that she and Kate should ride over to Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill, as
      the place was already named, and call on Mrs. Medlicot. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      Christian,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for people living out in the bush as we
      are to quarrel with their neighbors just because they are neighbors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neighbors!&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any word
      that there&rsquo;s so much humbug about. The Samaritan was the best
      neighbor I ever heard of, and he lived a long way off, I take it. Anyway,
      he wasn&rsquo;t a free-selector.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, that&rsquo;s profane.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing I say is wicked. You can go, of course, if you like it.
      I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel with any body.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarreling is so uncomfortable,&rdquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter of taste. There are people whom I find it
      very comfortable to quarrel with. I shouldn&rsquo;t at all like not to
      quarrel with the Brownbies, and I&rsquo;m not at all sure it mayn&rsquo;t
      come to be the same with Mr. Giles Medlicot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brownbies live by sheep-stealing and horse-stealing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Medlicot means to live by employing sheep-stealers and
      horse-stealers. You can go if you like it. You won&rsquo;t want me to go
      with you. Will you have the baggy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ladies said that they would ride. The air was cooler now than it
      had been, and they would like the exercise. They would take Jacko with
      them to open the slip-rails, and they would be back by seven for dinner.
      So they started, taking the track by the wool-shed. The wool-shed was
      about two miles from the station, and Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill was seven
      miles farther, on the bank of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles Medlicot, though at Gangoil he was still spoken of as a
      new-comer, had already been located for nearly two years on the land which
      he had purchased immediately on his coming to the colony. He had come out
      direct from England with the intention of growing sugar, and, whether
      successful or not in making money, had certainly succeeded in growing
      crops of sugar-canes and in erecting a mill for crushing them. It probably
      takes more than two years for a man himself to discover whether he can
      achieve ultimate success in such an enterprise; and Medlicot was certainly
      not a man likely to talk much to others of his private concerns. The mill
      had just been built, and he had lived there himself as soon as a
      water-tight room had been constructed. It was only within the last three
      months that he had completed a small cottage residence, and had brought
      his mother to live with him. Hitherto he had hardly made himself popular.
      He was not either fish or fowl. The squatters regarded him as an
      interloper, and as a man holding opinions directly averse to their own
      interests&mdash;in which they were right. And the small free-selectors,
      who lived on the labor of their own hands&mdash;or, as was said of many of
      them, by stealing sheep and cattle&mdash;knew well that he was not of
      their class. But Medlicot had gone his way steadfastly, if not happily,
      and complained aloud to no one in the midst of his difficulties. He had
      not, perhaps, found the Paradise which he had expected in Queensland, but
      he had found that he could grow sugar; and having begun the work, he was
      determined to go on with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heathcote was his nearest neighbor, and the only man in his own rank of
      life who lived within twenty miles of him. When he had started his
      enterprise he had hoped to make this man his friend, not comprehending at
      first how great a cause for hostility was created by the very purchase of
      the land. He had been a new-comer from the old country, and, being alone,
      had desired friendship. He was Harry Heathcote&rsquo;s equal in education,
      intelligence, and fortune, if not in birth&mdash;which surely, in the
      Australian bush, need not count for much. He had assumed, when first
      meeting the squatter, that good-fellowship between them, on equal terms,
      would be acceptable to both; but his overtures had been coldly received.
      Then he, too, had drawn himself up, had declared that Heathcote was an
      ignorant ass, and had unconsciously made up his mind to commence
      hostilities. It was in this spirit that he had taken Nokes into his mill,
      of whose character, had he inquired about it, he would certainly have
      heard no good. He had now brought his mother to Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill. She
      and the Gangoil ladies had met each other on neutral ground, and it was
      almost necessary that they should either be friends or absolute enemies.
      Mrs. Heathcote had been aware of this, and bad declared that enmity was
      horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I sometimes think that
      friendship is more so. I suppose I&rsquo;m fitted for bush life, for I
      want to see no one from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end but my own
      family and my own people.&rdquo; And yet this young patriarch in the
      wilderness was only twenty-four years old, and had been educated at an
      English school!
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot&rsquo;s cottage was about a hundred and fifty yards from the
      mill, looking down upon the Mary, the banks of which at this spot were
      almost precipitous. The site for the plantation had been chosen because
      the river afforded the means of carriage down to the sea, and the mill had
      been so constructed that the sugar hogsheads could be lowered from the
      buildings into the river boats. Here Mrs. Heathcote and Kate Daly found
      the old lady sitting at work, all alone, in the veranda. She was a
      handsome old woman, with gray hair, seventy years of age, with wrinkled
      face, and a toothless mouth, but with bright eyes, and with no signs of
      the infirmity of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is gey kind of you to run so far to see an auld woman,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heathcote declared that they were used to the heat, and that after
      the rain the air was pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re two bright lassies, and you&rsquo;re hearty,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m auld, and just out of Cumberland, and I find it&rsquo;s
      hot enough&mdash;and I&rsquo;m no guid at horseback at all. I dinna know
      how I&rsquo;m to get aboot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Heathcote explained that there was an excellent track for a
      buggy all the way to Gangoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giles is aye telling me that I&rsquo;m to gang aboot in a bouggey,
      but I dinna feel sure of thae bouggeys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heathcote, of course, praised the country carriages, and the country
      roads, and the country generally. Tea was brought in, and the old lady was
      delighted with her guests. Since she had been at the mill, week had
      followed week, and she had seen no woman&rsquo;s face but that of the
      uncouth girl who waited upon her. &ldquo;Did ye ever see rain like that!&rdquo;
      she said, putting up her hands. &ldquo;I thought the Lord was sending his
      clouds down upon us in a lump like.&rdquo; Then she told them that some of
      the men had declared that if it went on like that for two hours the Mary
      would rise and take the cottage away. Giles, however, had declared that to
      be trash, as the cottage was twenty feet above the ordinary course of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just rising to take their leave, when Giles Medlicot himself
      came in out of the mill. He was a man of good presence, dark, and tall
      like Heathcote, but stoutly made, with a strongly marked face, given to
      frowning much when he was eager; bright-eyed, with a broad forehead&mdash;certainly
      a man to be observed as far as his appearance was concerned. He was
      dressed much as a gentleman dresses in the country at home, and was
      therefore accounted to be a fop by Harry Heathcote, who was rarely seen
      abroad in other garb than that which has been described. Harry was an
      aristocrat, and hated such innovations in the bush as cloth coats and
      tweed trowsers and neck-hand-kerchiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot had been full of wrath against his neighbor all the morning.
      There had been a tone in Heathcote&rsquo;s voice when he gave his parting
      warning as to the fire in Medlicot&rsquo;s pipe which the sugar grower had
      felt to be intentionally insolent. Nothing had been said which could be
      openly resented, but offense had surely been intended; and then he had
      remembered that his mother had been already some months at the mill, and
      that no mark of neighborly courtesy had been shown to her. The Heathcotes
      had, he thought, chosen to assume themselves to be superior to him and
      his, and to treat him as though he had been some laboring man who had
      saved money enough to purchase a bit of land for himself. He was,
      therefore, astonished to find the two young ladies sitting with his mother
      on the very day after such an interview as that of the preceding night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The leddies from Gangoil, Giles, have been guid enough to ride over
      and see me,&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot, of course, shook hands with them, and expressed his sense of
      their kindness, but he did it awkwardly. He soon, however, declared his
      purpose of riding part of the way back with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heathcote must have been very wet last night,&rdquo; he said,
      when they were on horse-back, addressing himself to Kate Daly rather than
      to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he was&mdash;wet to the skin. Were you not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him at about eleven, before the rain began. I was close home,
      and just escaped. He must have been under it all. Does he often go about
      the run in that way at night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only when he&rsquo;s afraid of fires,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much to be afraid of? I don&rsquo;t suppose that any body
      can be so wicked as to wish to burn the grass.&rdquo; Then the ladies took
      upon themselves to explain. &ldquo;The fires might be caused from
      negligence or trifling accidents, or might possibly come from the unaided
      heat of the sun; or there might be enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! yes; enemies, rather!&rdquo; said Jacko, who was riding
      close behind, and who had no idea of being kept out of the conversation
      merely because he was a servant. Medlicot, turning round, looked at the
      lad, and asked who were the enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free-selectors,&rdquo; said Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a free-selector,&rdquo; said Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not jist mean you,&rdquo; said Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacko, you&rsquo;d better hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Heathcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold my tongue! My word! Well, you go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot came as far as the wool-shed, and then said that he would return.
      He had thoroughly enjoyed his ride. Kate Daly was bright and pretty and
      winning; and in the bush, when a man has not seen a lady perhaps for
      months, brightness and prettiness and winning ways have a double charm. To
      ride with fair women over turf, through a forest, with a woman who may
      perhaps some day be wooed, can be a matter of indifference only to a very
      lethargic man. Giles Medlicot was by no means lethargic. He owned to
      himself that though Heathcote was a pig-headed ass, the ladies were very
      nice, and he thought that the pig-headed ass in choosing one of them for
      himself had by no means taken the nicest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never find your way back,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;if
      you&rsquo;ve not been here before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was here before, and I suppose I must find my way back.&rdquo;
      Then he was urged to come on and dine at Gangoil, with a promise that
      Jacko should return with him in the evening. But this he would not do.
      Heathcote was a pig-headed ass, who possibly regarded him as an incendiary
      simply because he had bought some land. This boy of Heathcote&rsquo;s,
      whose services had been offered to him, had not scrupled to tell him to
      his face that he was to be regarded as an enemy. Much as he liked the
      company of Kate Daly, he could not go to the house of that stupid,
      arrogant, pig-headed young squatter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not such a bad
      bushman but what I can find my way to the river,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find it blindful,&rdquo; said Jacko, who did not relish the idea of
      going back to Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill as guide to another man. There was a
      weakness in the idea that such aid could be necessary, which was revolting
      to Jacko&rsquo;s sense of bush independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing on their horses at the entrance to the wool-shed as
      they discussed the point, when suddenly Harry himself appeared out of the
      building. He came up and shook hands with Medlicot, with sufficient
      courtesy, but hardly with cordiality, and then asked his wife as to her
      ride. &ldquo;We have been very jolly, haven&rsquo;t we, Kate? Of course it
      has been hot, but every thing is not so frightfully parched as it was
      before the rain. As Mr. Medlicot has come back so far with us, we want him
      to come on and dine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do, Mr. Medlicot,&rdquo; said Harry. But again the tone of his
      voice was not sufficiently hearty to satisfy the man who was invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, no: I think I&rsquo;ll hardly do that.&mdash;Good-night,
      Mrs. Heathcote; good-night. Miss Daly;&rdquo; and the two ladies
      immediately perceived that his voice, which had hitherto been pleasant in
      their ears, had ceased to be cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad he has gone back,&rdquo; said Heathcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say so, Harry? You are not given to be inhospitable, and
      why should you grudge me and Kate the rare pleasure of seeing a strange
      face?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why. It&rsquo;s not about him at this moment;
      but I&rsquo;ve been disturbed.&mdash;Jacko, go on to the station, and say
      we&rsquo;re coming. Do you hear me? Go on at once.&rdquo; Then Jacko,
      somewhat unwillingly, galloped off toward the house. &ldquo;Get off your
      horses, and come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped the two ladies from their saddles, and they all went into the
      wool-shed, Harry leading the way. In one of the side pens, immediately
      under the roof, there was a large heap of leaves, the outside portion of
      which was at present damp, for the rain had beaten in upon it, but which
      had been as dry as tinder when collected; and there was a row or ridge of
      mixed brush-wood and leaves so constructed as to form a line from the
      grass outside on to the heap. &ldquo;The fellow who did that was an ass,&rdquo;
      said Harry; &ldquo;a greater ass than I should have taken him to be, not
      to have known that if he could have gotten the grass to burn outside, the
      wool-shed must have gone without all that preparation. But there isn&rsquo;t
      much difficulty now in seeing what the fellow has intended.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it for a fire?&rdquo; asked Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been contented with the
      grass and fences, but wanted to make sure of the shed also. He&rsquo;d
      have come to the house and burned us in our beds, only a fellow like that
      is too much of a coward to run the risk of being seen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Harry, why didn&rsquo;t he light it when he&rsquo;d done it?&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Heathcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the Almighty sent the rain at the very moment,&rdquo; said
      Harry, striking the top rail of one of the pens with his fist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not much given to talk about Providence, but this looks like it, does it
      not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have put a match in at the moment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain or no rain? Yes, he might. But he was interrupted by more than
      the rain. I got into the shed myself just at the moment&mdash;I and Jacko.
      It was last night, when the rain was pouring. I heard the man, and dark as
      was the night, I saw his figure as he fled away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know him?&rdquo; said Miss Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that boy, who has the eyes of a cat, he knew him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacko?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacko knew him by his gait. I should have hardly wanted any one to
      tell me who it was. I could have named the man at once, but for the fear
      of doing an injustice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend Medlicot&rsquo;s prime favorite and new factotum, Mr.
      William Nokes. Mr. William Nokes is the gentleman who intends to burn us
      all out of house and home, and Mr. Medlicot is the gentleman whose
      pleasure it is to keep Mr. Nokes in the neighborhood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women stood awe-struck for a moment, but a sense of justice
      prevailed upon the wife to speak. &ldquo;That may be all true,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Perhaps it is as you say about that man. But you would not
      therefore think that Mr. Medlicot knows any thing about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be impossible,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not accused him,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but he knows that
      the man was dismissed, and yet keeps him about the place. Of course he is
      responsible.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; HARRY HEATHCOTE&rsquo;S APPEAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the first mile between the wool-shed and the house Heathcote and the
      two ladies rode without saying a word. There was something so terrible in
      the reality of the danger which encompassed them that they hardly felt
      inclined to discuss it. Harry&rsquo;s dislike to Medlicot was quite a
      thing apart. That some one had intended to burn down the wool-shed, and
      had made preparation for doing so, was as apparent to the women as to him.
      And the man who had been balked by a shower of rain in his first attempt
      might soon find an opportunity for a second. Harry was well aware that
      even Jacko&rsquo;s assertion could not be taken as evidence against the
      man whom he suspected. In all probability no further attempt would be made
      upon the wool-shed; but a fire on some distant part of the run would be
      much more injurious to him than the mere burning of a building. The fire
      that might ruin him would be one which should get ahead before it was
      seen, and scour across the ground, consuming the grass down to the very
      roots over thousands of acres, and destroying fencing over many miles.
      Such fires pass on, leaving the standing trees unscathed, avoiding even
      the scrub, which is too moist with the sap of life for consumption, but
      licking up with fearful rapidity every thing that the sun has dried. He
      could watch the wool-shed and house, but with no possible care could he so
      watch the whole run as to justify him in feeling security. There need be
      no preparation of leaves. A match thrown loosely on the ground would do
      it. And in regard to a match so thrown, it would be impossible to prove a
      guilty intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought we not to have dispersed the heap?&rdquo; said Mrs. Heathcote
      at last. The minds of all of them were full of the matter, but these were
      the first words spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it as it is,&rdquo; said Harry, giving no reason
      for his decision. He was too full of thought, too heavily laden with
      anxiety, to speak much. &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s get on; you&rsquo;ll want
      your dinner, and it&rsquo;s getting dark.&rdquo; So they cantered on, and
      got off their horses at the gate, without another word. And not another
      word was spoken on the subject that night. Harry was very silent, walking
      up and down the veranda with his pipe in his mouth&mdash;not lying on the
      ground in idle enjoyment&mdash;and there was no reading. The two sisters
      looked at him from time to time with wistful, anxious-eyes, half afraid to
      disturb him by speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for him, he felt that the weight was all on his own shoulders. He had
      worked hard, and was on the way to be rich. I do not know that he thought
      much about money, but he thought very much of success. And he was by
      nature anxious, sanguine, and impulsive. There might be before him, within
      the next week, such desolation as would break his heart. He knew men who
      had been ruined, and had borne their ruin almost without a wail&mdash;who
      had seemed contented to descend to security and mere absence from want.
      There was his own superintendent, Old Bates, who, though he grumbled at
      every thing else, never bewailed his own fate. But he knew of himself that
      any such blow would nearly kill him&mdash;such a blow, that is, as might
      drive him from Gangoil, and force him to be the servant instead of the
      master of men. Not to be master of all around him seemed to him to be
      misery. The merchants at Brisbane who took his wool and supplied him with
      stores had advanced money when he first bought his run, and he still owed
      them some thousands of pounds. The injury which a great fire would do him
      would bring him to such a condition that the merchants would demand to
      have their money repaid. He understood it all, and knew well that it was
      after this fashion that many a squatter before him had been ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak a word to me about it,&rdquo; his wife said to him,
      imploringly, when they were alone together that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, if there were a word to say, I would say it. I must be
      on the watch, and do the best I can. At present the earth is too damp for
      mischief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that it would rain again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be heat enough before the summer is over; we need not
      doubt that. But I will tell you of every thing as we go on. I will
      endeavor to have the man watched. God bless you! Go to sleep, and try to
      get it out of your thoughts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning he breakfasted early, and mounted his horse
      without saying a word as to the purport of his journey. This was in
      accordance with the habit of his life, and would not excite observation;
      but there was something in his manner which made both the ladies feel that
      he was intent on some special object. When he intended simply to ride
      round his fences or to visit the hut of some distant servant, a few
      minutes signified nothing. He would stand under the veranda and talk, and
      the women would endeavor to keep him from the saddle. But now there was no
      loitering, and but little talking. He said a word to Jacko, who brought
      the horse for him, and then started at a gallop toward the wool-shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not stop a moment at the shed, not even entering it to see whether
      the heap of leaves had been displaced during the night, but went on
      straight to Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill. He rode the nine miles in an hour, and
      at once entered the building in which the canes were crushed. The first
      man he met was Nokes, who acted as overseer, having a gang of Polynesian
      laborers under him&mdash;sleek, swarthy fellows from the South Sea
      Islands, with linen trowsers on and nothing else&mdash;who crept silently
      among the vats and machinery, shifting the sugar as it was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nokes,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;how are you getting on? Is
      Mr. Medlicot here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nokes was a big fellow, with a broad, solid face, which would not have
      condemned him among physiognomists but for a bad eye, which could not look
      you in the face. He had been a boundary rider for Heathcote, and on an
      occasion had been impertinent, refusing to leave the yard behind the house
      unless something was done which those about the place refused to do for
      him. During the discussion Harry had come in. The man had been drinking,
      and was still insolent, and Harry had ejected him violently, thrusting him
      over a gate. The man had returned the next morning, and had then been sent
      about his business. He had been employed at Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill, but
      from the day of his dismissal to this he and Harry had never met each
      other face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty well, thank ye, Mr. Heathcote. I hope you&rsquo;re
      the same, and the ladies. The master&rsquo;s about somewhere, I take it.&mdash;Picky,
      go and find the master.&rdquo; Picky was one of the Polynesians, who at
      once started on his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been over to Gangoil since you left it?&rdquo; said Harry,
      looking the man full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, Mr. Heathcote. I never go where I&rsquo;ve had words. And,
      to tell you the truth, sugar is better than sheep. I&rsquo;m very
      comfortable here, and I never liked your work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been at the wool-shed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, the Gangoil shed! What the blazes &lsquo;d I go there for? It&rsquo;s
      a matter of ten miles from here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven, Nokes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven, is it? It is a longish seven miles, Mr. Heathcote. How could
      I get that distance? I ain&rsquo;t so good at walking as I was before I
      was hurt. You should have remembered that, Mr. Heathcote, when you laid
      hands on me the other day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not much the worse for what I did; nor yet for the
      accident, I take it. At any rate, you&rsquo;ve not been at Gangoil
      wool-shed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; said the man, roughly. &ldquo;What the
      mischief should I be doing at your shed at night-time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing about night-time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here all day, ain&rsquo;t I? If you&rsquo;re going to
      palm off any story against me, Mr. Heathcote, you&rsquo;ll find yourself
      in the wrong box. What I does I does on the square.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Heathcote was now quite sure that Jacko had been right. He had not doubted
      much before, but now he did not doubt at all but that the man with whom he
      was speaking was the wretch who was endeavoring to ruin him. And he felt
      certain, also, that Jacko was true to him. He knew, too, that he had
      plainly declared his suspicion to the man himself. But he had resolved
      upon doing this. He could in no way assist himself in circumventing the
      man&rsquo;s villainy by keeping his suspense to himself. The man might be
      frightened, and in spite of all that had passed between him and Medlicot,
      he still thought it possible that he might induce the sugar grower to
      co-operate with him in driving Nokes from the neighborhood. He had spent
      the night in thinking over it all, and this was the resolution to which he
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the master,&rdquo; said Nokes. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve
      got any thing to say about any thing, you&rsquo;d better say it to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had never before set his foot upon Medlicot&rsquo;s land since it
      had been bought away from his own run, and had felt that he would almost
      demean himself by doing so. He had often looked at the canes from over his
      own fence, as he had done on the night of the rain; but he had stood
      always on his own land. Now he was in the sugar-mill, never before having
      seen such a building. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a deal of machinery here, Mr.
      Medlicot,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small affair, after all,&rdquo; said the other.
      &ldquo;I hope to get a good plant before I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak a word with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Will you come into the office, or will you go across to
      the house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry said that the office would do, and followed Medlicot into a little
      box-like inclosure which contained a desk and two stools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much of an office, is it? What can I do for you, Mr. Heathcote?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Harry began his story, which he told at considerable length. He
      apologized for troubling his neighbor at all on the subject, and
      endeavored to explain, somewhat awkwardly, that as Mr. Medlicot was a
      new-comer, he probably might not understand the kind of treatment to which
      employers in the bush were occasionally subject from their men. On this
      matter he said much, which, had he been a better tactician, he might
      probably have left unspoken. He then went on to the story of his own
      quarrel with Nokes, who had, in truth, been grossly impudent to the women
      about the house, but who had been punished by instant and violent
      dismissal from his employment. It was evidently Harry&rsquo;s idea that a
      man who had so sinned against his master should be allowed to find no
      other master&mdash;at any rate in that district; an idea with which the
      other man, who had lately come out from the old country, did not at all
      sympathize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to dismiss him?&rdquo; said Medlicot, in a tone
      which implied that that would be the last thing he would think of doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard me yet.&rdquo; Then Harry went on and told
      of the fires in the heat of summer, and of their terrible effects&mdash;of
      the easy manner of revenge which they supplied to angry, unscrupulous men,
      and of his own fears at the present moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can believe it all,&rdquo; said Medlicot, &ldquo;and am very
      sorry that it should be so. But I can not see the justice of punishing a
      man on the merest, vaguest suspicion. Your only ground for imputing this
      crime to him is that your own conduct to him may have given him a motive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had schooled himself vigorously during the ride as to his own
      demeanor, and had resolved that he would be cool. &ldquo;I was going on to
      tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what occurred that night after I saw you
      up by the fence.&rdquo; Then he described how he and his boy had entered
      the shed, and had both seen and heard a man as he escaped from it; how the
      boy had at once declared that the man was Nokes; how the following day he
      had discovered the leaves, which Nokes no doubt had deposited there just
      before the rain, intending to burn the place at once; and how Nokes&rsquo;s
      manner to him within the last half hour had corroborated his suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he the boy you call Jacko?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name he goes by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know his real name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard any other name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor any thing about him?&rdquo; Harry owned, in answer to half a
      dozen such questions, that Jacko had come to Gangoil about six months ago&mdash;he
      did not know whence&mdash;had been kept for a week&rsquo;s job, and had
      then been allowed to remain about the place without any regular wages.
      &ldquo;You admit it was quite dark,&rdquo; continued Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry did not at all like the cross-examination, and his resolution to be
      cool was quickly fading. &ldquo;I told you that I saw myself the figure of
      a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that you barely saw a figure. You did not form any opinion of
      your own as to the man&rsquo;s identity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Heathcote was as honest as the sun. Much as he disliked being
      cross-examined, he found himself compelled not only to say the exact
      truth, but the whole truth. &ldquo;Certainly not. I barely saw a glimpse
      of a figure, and, till I spoke to Nokes just now, I almost doubted whether
      the lad could have distinguished him. I am sure he was right now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Heathcote, I can&rsquo;t go along with you. You are
      accusing a man of committing an offense, which I believe is capital, on
      the evidence of a boy of whom you know nothing, who may have his own
      reasons for spiting the man, and whom you yourself did not believe till
      you had looked this man in the face. I think you allow yourself to be
      guided too much by your own power of intuition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Harry, who hated his neighbor&rsquo;s
      methodical argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I can&rsquo;t consent to take a man&rsquo;s bread out
      of his mouth, and to send him away tainted as he would be with this
      suspicion, either because Jacko thought that he saw him in the dark, or
      because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never asked you to send him away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to have him watched, so that he may feel that if he attempts
      to destroy my property his guilt will be detected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is to watch him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in your employment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives in the hut down beyond the gate. Am I to keep a sentry
      there all night, and every night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will pay for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Heathcote. I don&rsquo;t pretend to know this country yet,
      but I&rsquo;ll encourage no such espionage as that. At any rate, it is not
      English. I dare say the man misbehaved himself in your employment. You say
      he was drunk. I do not doubt it. But he is not a drunkard, for he never
      drinks here. A man is not to starve forever because he once got drunk and
      was impertinent. Nor is he to have a spy at his heels because a boy whom
      nobody knows chooses to denounce him. I am sorry that you should be in
      trouble, but I do not know that I can help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s passion was now very high, and his resolution to be cool was
      almost thrown to the winds. Medlicot had said many things which were
      odious to him. In the first place, there had been a tone of insufferable
      superiority, so Harry thought, and that, too, when he himself had divested
      himself of all the superiority naturally attached to his position, and had
      frankly appealed to Medlicot as a neighbor. And then this new-fangled
      sugar grower had told him that he was not English, and had said grand
      words, and had altogether made himself objectionable. What did this man
      know of the Australian bush, that he should dare to talk of this or that
      as being wrong because it was un-English! In England there were police to
      guard men&rsquo;s property. Here, out in the Australian forests, a man
      must guard his own, or lose it. But perhaps it was the indifference to the
      ruin of the women belonging to him that Harry Heathcote felt the
      strongest. The stranger cared nothing for the utter desolation which one
      unscrupulous ruffian might produce, felt no horror at the idea of a vast
      devastating fire, but could be indignant in his mock philanthropy because
      it was proposed to watch the doings of a scoundrel!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Harry, turning round and leaving the
      office brusquely. Medlicot followed him, but Harry went so quickly that
      not another word was spoken. To him the idea of a neighbor in the bush
      refusing such assistance as he had asked was as terrible as to us is the
      thought of a ship at sea leaving another ship in distress. He unhitched
      his horse from the fence, and galloped home as fast as the animal would
      carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot, when he was left alone, took two or three turns about the mill,
      as though inspecting the work, but at every turn fixed his eyes for a few
      moments on Noke&rsquo;s face. The man was standing under a huge caldron
      regulating the escape of the boiling juice into the different vats by
      raising and lowering a trap, and giving directions to the Polynesians as
      he did so. He was evidently conscious that he was being regarded, and, as
      is usual in such a condition, manifestly failed in his struggle to appear
      unconscious. Medlicot acknowledged to himself that the man could not look
      even him in the face. Was it possible that he had been wrong, and that
      Heathcote, though he had expressed himself badly, was entitled to some
      sympathy in his fear of what might be done to him by an enemy? Medlicot
      also desired to be just, being more rational, more logical, and less
      impulsive than the other, being also somewhat too conscious of his own
      superior intelligence. He knew that Heathcote had gone away in great
      dudgeon, and he almost feared that he had been harsh and unneighborly.
      After a while he stood opposite Nokes and addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do the squatters suffer much from fires?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heathcote has been talking to you about that,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you say Mr. Heathcote when you speak of a gentleman
      whose bread you have eaten?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heathcote, if you like it. We ain&rsquo;t particular to a shade
      out here as you are at home. He has been telling you about fires, has he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And talking of me, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were talking of having a turn at mining some day. How would it
      be with you if you were to be off to Gympie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say I&rsquo;m to go, Mr. Medlicot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Medlicot. My going or staying won&rsquo;t make any
      difference to Heathcote. There&rsquo;s a lot of &rsquo;em about here hates
      him that much that he is never to be allowed to rest in peace. I tell you
      that fairly. It ain&rsquo;t any thing as I shall do. Them&rsquo;s not my
      ways, Mr. Medlicot. But he has enemies here as&rsquo;ll never let him
      rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty nigh every body round. He has carried himself that high they
      won&rsquo;t stand him. Who&rsquo;s Heathcote?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name some who are his enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Brownbies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Brownbies. Well, it&rsquo;s a bad thing to have enemies.&rdquo;
      After that he left the sugar-house and went across to the cottage.

      CHAPTER V. &mdash; BOSCOBEL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days and two nights passed without fear of fire, and then Harry
      Heathcote was again on the alert. The earth was parched as though no drop
      of rain had fallen. The fences were dry as tinder, and the ground was
      strewed with broken atoms of timber from the trees, each of which a spark
      would ignite. Two nights Harry slept in his bed, but on the third he was
      on horseback about the run, watching, thinking, endeavoring to make
      provision, directing others, and hoping to make it believed that his eyes
      were every where. In this way an entire week was passed, and now it wanted
      but four days to Christmas. He would come home to breakfast about seven in
      the morning, very tired, but never owning that he was tired, and then
      sleep heavily for an hour or two in a chair. After that he would go out
      again on the run, would sleep perhaps for another hour after dinner, and
      then would start for his night&rsquo;s patrol. During this week he saw
      nothing of Medlicot, and never mentioned his name but once. On that
      occasion his wife told him that during his absence Medlicot had been at
      the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought him here?&rdquo; Harry asked, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heathcote explained that he had called in a friendly way, and had
      said that if there were any fear of fire he would be happy himself to lend
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young squatter forgot himself in his wrath. &ldquo;Confound his
      hypocrisy!&rdquo; said Harry, aloud. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s
      a hypocrite,&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; said Kate Daly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word more was spoken, and Harry immediately left the house. The two
      women did not as usual go to the gate to see him mount his horse, not
      refraining from doing so in any anger, or as wishing to exhibit
      displeasure at Harry&rsquo;s violence, but because they were afraid of
      him. They had found themselves compelled to differ from him, but were
      oppressed at finding themselves in opposition to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling that his wife should in any way take part against him added
      greatly to Heathcote&rsquo;s trouble. It produced in his mind a terrible
      feeling of loneliness in his sorrow. He bore a brave outside to all his
      men, and to any stranger whom in these days he met about the run&mdash;to
      his wife and sister also, and to the old woman at home. He forced upon
      them all an idea that he was not only autocratic, but self-sufficient also&mdash;that
      he wanted neither help nor sympathy. He never cried out in his pain, being
      heartily ashamed even of the appeal which he had made to Medlicot. He
      spoke aloud and laughed with the men, and never acknowledged that his
      trials were almost too much for him. But he was painfully conscious of his
      own weakness. He sometimes felt, when alone in the bush, that he would
      fain get off his horse, and lie upon the ground and weep till he slept. It
      was not that he trusted no one. He suspected no one with a positive
      suspicion, except Nokes, and Medlicot as the supporter of Nokes. But he
      had no one with whom he could converse freely&mdash;none whom he had not
      been accustomed to treat as the mere ministers of his will&mdash;except
      his wife and his wife&rsquo;s sister; and now he was disjoined from them
      by their sympathy with Medlicot! He had chosen to manage every thing
      himself without contradiction and almost without counsel; but, like other
      such imperious masters, he now found that when trouble came the privilege
      of dictatorship brought with it an almost unsupportable burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bates was an excellent man, of whose fidelity the young squatter was
      quite assured. No one understood foot-rot better than Old Bates, or was
      less sparing of himself in curing it. He was a second mother to all the
      lambs, and when shearing came watched with the eyes of Argus to see that
      the sheep were not wounded by the shearers, or the wool left on their
      backs. But he had no conversation, none of that imagination which in such
      a time as this might have assisted in devising safeguards, and but little
      enthusiasm. Shepherds, so called, Harry kept none upon the run; and would
      have felt himself insulted had any one suggested that he was so backward
      in his ways as to employ men of that denomination. He had fenced his run,
      and dispensed with shepherds and shepherding as old-fashioned and
      unprofitable. He had two mounted men, whom he called boundary riders, one
      an Irishman and the other a German&mdash;and them he trusted fully, the
      German altogether, and the Irishman equally as regarded his honesty. But
      he could not explain to them the thoughts that loaded his brain. He could
      instigate them to eagerness; but he could not condescend to tell Karl
      Bender, the German, that if his fences were destroyed neither his means
      nor his credit would be sufficient to put them up again, and that if the
      scanty herbage were burned off any large proportion of his run, he must
      sell his flocks at a great sacrifice. Nor could he explain to Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd,
      the Irishman, that his peace of mind was destroyed by his fear of one man.
      He had to bear it all alone. And there was heavy on him also the great
      misery of feeling that every thing might depend on own exertions, and that
      yet he did not know how or where to exert himself. When he had ridden
      about all night and discovered nothing, he might just as well have been in
      bed. And he was continually riding about all night and discovering
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving the station on the evening of the day on which he had
      expressed himself to the women so vehemently respecting Medlicot, he met
      Bates coming home from his day&rsquo;s work. It was then past eight o&rsquo;clock,
      and the old man was sitting wearily on his horse, with his head low down
      between his shoulders, and the reins hardly held within his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late, Mr. Bates,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;you take
      too much out of yourself this hot weather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to move slower, Mr. Heathcote, as I grow older. That&rsquo;s
      about it. And the beast I&rsquo;m on is not much good.&rdquo; Now Mr.
      Bates was always complaining of his horse, and yet was allowed to choose
      any on the run for his own use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like him, why don&rsquo;t you take another?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t much difference in &rsquo;em, Mr. Heathcote.
      Better the devil you know than the devil you don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s
      getting uncommon close shaving for them wethers in the new paddock. They&rsquo;re
      down upon the roots pretty well already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s grass along the bush on the north side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t go there; it&rsquo;s rank and sour. They won&rsquo;t
      feed up there as long as they can live lower down and nearer the water.
      Weather like this, they&rsquo;d sooner die near the water than travel to
      fill their bellies. It&rsquo;s about the hottest day we&rsquo;ve had, and
      the nights a&rsquo;most hotter. Are you going to be out, Mr. Heathcote?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of it, Mr. Heathcote? There is no use in it.
      Lord love you, what can yon do? You can&rsquo;t be every side at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire can only travel with the wind, Mr. Bates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there isn&rsquo;t any wind, and so there can&rsquo;t be any
      fire. I never did think, and I don&rsquo;t think now, there ever was any
      use in a man fashing himself as you fash yourself. You can&rsquo;t alter
      things, Mr. Heathcote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just what I can do&mdash;what a man has to do. If
      a match were thrown there at your feet, and the grass was aflame, couldn&rsquo;t
      you alter that by putting your foot on it? If you find a ewe on her back,
      can&rsquo;t you alter that by putting her on her legs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can do that, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does a man live for except to alter things? When a man clears
      the forest and sows corn, does he not alter things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your line, Mr. Heathcote,&rdquo; said the cunning
      old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I send wool to market, I alter things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mr. Heathcote. Of course I&rsquo;m old, but
      I just give you my experience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you; though we can&rsquo;t always agree,
      you know. Good-night. Go in and say a word to my wife, and tell them you
      saw me all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a crack with &rsquo;em, Mr. Heathcote, before I
      turn in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell Mary I sent my love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Mr. Heathcote; I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking always of his wife during his solitary rides, and of her
      fear and deep anxiety. It was for her sake and for the children that he
      was so care-worn, not for his own. Had he been alone in the world he would
      not have fretted himself in this fashion because of the malice of any man.
      But how would it be with her should he be forced to move her from Gangoil?
      And yet, with all his love, they had parted almost in anger. Surely she
      would understand the tenderness of the message he had just sent her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden, as he was riding, he stopped his horse and listened
      attentively. From a great distance there fell upon his accustomed ear a
      sound which he recognized, though he was aware that the place from whence
      it came was at least two miles distant. It was the thud of an axe against
      a tree. He listened still, and was sure that it was so, and turned at once
      toward the sound, though in doing so he left his course at a right angle.
      He had been going directly away from the river, with his back to the
      wool-shed; but now he changed his course, riding in the direction of the
      spot at which Jacko had nearly fallen in jumping over the fence. As he
      continued on, the sounds became plainer, till at last, reining in his
      horse, he could see the form of the woodman, who was still at work ringing
      the trees. This was a job which the man did by contract, receiving so much
      an acre for the depopulation of the timber. It was now bright moonlight,
      almost as clear as day&mdash;a very different night, indeed, from that on
      which the rain had come&mdash;and Harry could see at a glance that it was
      the man called Boscobel still at work. Now there were, as he thought, very
      good reasons why Boscobel at the present moment should not be so employed.
      Boscobel was receiving wages for work of another kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bos,&rdquo; said the squatter, riding up, and addressing the man by
      the customary abbreviation of his nickname, &ldquo;I thought you were
      watching at Brownbie&rsquo;s boundary?&rdquo; Boscobel lowered his axe,
      and stood for a while contemplating the proposition made to him. &ldquo;You
      are drawing three shillings a night for watching; isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. Anyways, I shall draw it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why ain&rsquo;t you watching?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to watch that I knows on&mdash;not just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should I pay you for it? I&rsquo;m to pay you for ringing
      these trees, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Heathcote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re to make double use of your time, and sell it
      twice over, are you? Don&rsquo;t try to look like a fool, as though you
      didn&rsquo;t understand. You know that what you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t
      honest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever said as I wasn&rsquo;t honest before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you so now. You&rsquo;re robbing me of the time you&rsquo;ve
      sold to me, and for which I&rsquo;m to pay you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothing to watch while the wind&rsquo;s as it is
      now, and that chap ain&rsquo;t any where about to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What chap?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. I&rsquo;m all right. What&rsquo;s the use of dawdling
      about up there in the broad moonlight, and the wind like this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for me to judge. If you engage to do my work and take
      my money, you&rsquo;re swindling me when you go about another job as you
      are now. You needn&rsquo;t scratch your head. You understand it all as
      well as I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was told I swindled before, and I ain&rsquo;t a-going to
      put up with it. You may ring your own trees, and watch your own fences,
      and the whole place may be burned for me. I ain&rsquo;t a-going to do
      another turn in Gangoil. Swindle, indeed!&rdquo; So Boscobel shouldered
      his axe, and marched off through the forest, visible in the moonlight till
      the trees hid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another enemy made! He had never felt quite sure of this man,
      but had been glad to have him about the place as being thoroughly
      efficient in his own business. It was only during the last ten days that
      he had agreed to pay him for night-watching, leaving the man to do as much
      additional day-work as he pleased&mdash;for which, of course, he would be
      paid at the regular contract price. There was a double purpose intended in
      this watching&mdash;as was well understood by all the hands employed:
      first, that of preventing incendiary fire by the mere presence of the
      watchers; and secondly, that of being at hand to extinguish fire in case
      of need. Now a man ringing trees five or six miles away from the beat on
      which he was stationed could not serve either of these purposes. Boscobel
      therefore had been fraudulently at work for his own dishonest purposes,
      and knew well that his employment was of that nature. All this was quite
      clear to Heathcote; and it was clear to him, also, that when he detected
      fraud he was bound to expose it. Had the man acknowledged his fault and
      been submissive, there would have been an end of the matter. Heathcote
      would have said no word about it to any one, and would not have stopped a
      farthing from the week&rsquo;s unearned wages. That he had to encounter a
      certain amount of ill usage from the rough men about him, and to forgive
      it, he could understand; but it could not be his duty, either as a man or
      a master, to pass over dishonesty without noticing it. No; that he would
      not do, though Gangoil should burn from end to end. He did not much mind
      being robbed. He knew that to a certain extent he must endure to be
      cheated. He would endure it. But he would never teach his men to think
      that he passed over such matters because he was afraid of them, or that
      dishonesty on their part was indifferent to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he had made another enemy&mdash;an enemy of a man who had declared
      to him that he knew the movements of &ldquo;that chap,&rdquo; meaning
      Nokes! How hard the world was! It seemed that all around were trouble to
      him. He turned his horse back, and made again for the spot which was his
      original destination. As he cantered on among the trees, twisting here and
      there, and regulating his way by the stars, he asked himself whether it
      would not be better for him to go home and lay himself down by his wife
      and sleep, and await the worst that these men could do to him. This idea
      was so strong upon him that at one spot he made his horse stop till he had
      thought it all out. No one encouraged him in his work. Every one about the
      place, friend or foe, Bates, his wife, Medlicot, and this Boscobel, spoke
      to him as though he were fussy and fidgety in his anxiety. &ldquo;If fires
      must come, they will come; and if they are not to come, you are simply
      losing your labor.&rdquo; This was the upshot of all they said to him. Why
      should he be wiser than they? If the ruin came, let it come. Old Bates had
      been ruined, but still had enough to eat and drink, and clothes to wear,
      and did not work half as hard as his employer. He thought that if he could
      only find some one person who would sympathize with him and support him,
      he would not mind. But the mental loneliness of his position almost broke
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came across his mind the dim remembrance of certain old school
      words, and he touched his horse with his spur and hurried onward: &ldquo;Let
      there be no steps backward.&rdquo; A thought as to the manliness of
      persevering, of the want of manliness in yielding to depression, came to
      his rescue. Let him, at any rate, have the comfort of thinking that he had
      done his best according to his lights. After some dim fashion, he did come
      to recognize it as a fact that nothing could really support him but
      self-approbation. Though he fell from his horse in utter weariness, he
      would persevere.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the night wore on he came to the German&rsquo;s hut, and finding it
      empty, as he expected, rode on to the outside fence of his run. When he
      reached this he got off his horse, and taking a key out of his pocket,
      whistled upon it loudly. A few minutes afterward the German came up to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been no one about, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a one,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been across on Brownbie&rsquo;s run?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on it now, Mr. &lsquo;Eathcote.&rdquo; They were both
      on the side of the fence away from Gangoil station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how that is, Karl. I think Gangoil goes a
      quarter of a mile beyond this. But we did not quite strike the boundary
      when we put up the fence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brownbie&rsquo;s cattle is allays here, Mr. &lsquo;Eathcote, and is
      knocking down the fence every day. Brownbie is a rascal, and &lsquo;is
      cattle as bad as &lsquo;isself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, Karl, now. When we&rsquo;ve got through the heats,
      we&rsquo;ll put a mile or two of better fencing along here. You know
      Boscobel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In course I know Bos.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a fellow is he?&rdquo; Then Harry told his German
      dependent exactly what had taken place between him and the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in and in wid all them young Brownbies,&rdquo; said
      Karl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brownbies are a bad lot, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d
      do any thing of this kind,&rdquo; said Harry, whose mind was still
      dwelling on the dangers of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They likes muttons, Mr. &lsquo;Eathcote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they do take a sheep or two now and then. They wouldn&rsquo;t
      do worse than that, would they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&rsquo;ing too &lsquo;ot for &rsquo;em; not&rsquo;ing too
      &lsquo;eavy,&rdquo; said Karl, smoking his pipe. &ldquo;The vind, vat
      there is, comes just here, Mr. &lsquo;Eathcote.&rdquo; And the man lifted
      up his arm, and pointed across in the direction of Brownbie&rsquo;s run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think much of Boscobel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl Bender shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was always well treated here,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;and has
      had plenty of work, and earned large wages. The man will be a fool to
      quarrel with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl again shook his head. With Karl Bender, Harry was quite sure of his
      man, but not on that account need he be quite sure of the correctness of
      the man&rsquo;s opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence he went on till he met his other lieutenant, O&rsquo;Dowd, and so,
      having completed his work, he made his way home, reaching the station at
      sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Bates tell you he&rsquo;d met me?&rdquo; he asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Harry; kiss me, Harry. I was so glad you sent a word. Promise
      me, Harry, not to think that I don&rsquo;t agree with you in every thing.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE BROWNBIES OF BOOLABONG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Brownbie, as he was usually called, was a squatter also, but a
      squatter of a class very different from that to which Heathcote belonged.
      He had begun his life in the colonies a little under a cloud, having been
      sent out from home after the perpetration of some peccadillo of which the
      law had disapproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In colonial phrase, he was a &ldquo;lag&rdquo;&mdash;having been
      transported; but this was many years ago, when he was quite young; and he
      had now been a free man for more than thirty years. It must be owned on
      his behalf that he had worked hard, had endeavored to rise, and had risen.
      But there still stuck to him the savor of his old life. Every one knew
      that he had been a convict; and even had he become a man of high principle&mdash;a
      condition which he certainly never achieved&mdash;he could hardly have
      escaped altogether from the thralldom of his degradation. He had been a
      butcher, a drover, part owner of stock, and had at last become possessed
      of a share of a cattle-run, and then of the entire property, such as it
      was. He had four or five sons, uneducated, ill-conditioned, drunken
      fellows, who had all their father&rsquo;s faults without his energy, some
      of whom had been in prison, and all of whom were known as pests to the
      colony. Their place was called Boolabong, and was a cattle-run, as
      distinguished from a sheep-run; but it was a poor place, was sometimes
      altogether unstocked, and was supposed to be not unfrequently used as a
      receptable for stolen cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tricks which the Brownbies played with cattle were notorious
      throughout Queensland and New South Wales, and by a certain class of men
      were much admired. They would drive a few head of cattle, perhaps forty or
      fifty, for miles around the country, across one station and another,
      traveling many hundreds of miles, and here and there, as they passed
      along, they would sweep into their own herd the bullocks of the victims
      whose lands they passed. If detected on the spot, they gave up their prey.
      They were in the right in moving their own cattle, and were not
      responsible for the erratic tendencies of other animals. If successful,
      they either sold their stolen beasts to butchers on the road, or got them
      home to Boolabong. There were dangers, of course, and occasional
      penalties. But there was much success. It was supposed, also, that though
      they did not own sheep, they preferred mutton for their daily uses, and
      that they supplied themselves at a very cheap rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be imagined how such a family would be hated by the respectable
      squatters on whom they preyed. Still there were men, old stagers, who had
      know Moreton Bay before it was a colony&mdash;in the old days when
      convicts were common&mdash;who almost regarded the Brownbies as a part of
      the common order of things, and who were indisposed to persecute them. Men
      must live; and what were a few sheep? Of some such it might be said, that
      though they were above the arts by which the Brownbies lived, they were
      not very scrupulous themselves; and it perhaps served them to have within
      their ken neighbours whose morality was lower even than their own. But to
      such a one as Harry Heathcote the Brownbies were utterly abominable. He
      was for the law and justice at any cost. To his thinking, the Colonial
      Government was grossly at fault, because it did not weed out and extirpate
      not only the identical Brownbies, but all Brownbieism wherever it might be
      found. A dishonest workman was a great evil, but, to his thinking, a
      dishonest man in the position of master was the incarnation of evil. As to
      the difficulties of evidence, and obstacles of that nature, Harry
      Heathcote knew nothing. The Brownbies were rascals, and should therefore
      be exterminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Brownbies knew well the estimation in which their neighbour held
      them. Harry had made himself altogether disagreeable to them. They were
      squatters as well as he&mdash;or at least so they termed themselves; and
      though they would not have expected to be admitted to home intimacies,
      they thought that when they were met out-of-doors or in public places,
      they should be treated with some respect. On such occasions Harry treated
      them as though they were dirt beneath his feet. The Brownbies would be
      found, whenever a little money came among them, at the public
      billiard-rooms and race-courses within one hundred and fifty miles of
      Boolabong. At such places Harry Heathcote was never seen. It would have
      been as easy to seduce the Bishop of Brisbane into a bet as Harry
      Heathcote. He had never even drank a nobbler with one of the Brownbies. To
      their thinking, he was a proud, stuck-up, unsocial young cub, whom to rob
      was a pleasure, and to ruin would be a delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man at Boolabong was now almost obsolete. Property, that he could
      keep in his grasp, there was in truth none. He was the tenant of the run
      under the Crown, and his sons would not turn him out of the house. The
      cattle, when there were cattle, belonged to them. They were in no respect
      subject to his orders, and he would have had a bad life among them were it
      not that they quarreled among themselves, and that in such quarrels he
      could belong to one party or to the other. The house itself was a wretched
      place&mdash;out of order, with doors and windows and floors shattered,
      broken, and decayed. There were none of womankind belonging to the family,
      and in such a house a decent woman-servant would have been out of her
      place. Sometimes there was one hag there and sometimes another, and
      sometimes feminine aid less respectable than that of the hags. There had
      been six sons. One had disappeared utterly, so that nothing was known of
      him. One had been absolutely expelled by the brethren, and was now a
      vagabond in the country, turning up now and then at Boolabong and
      demanding food. Of the whole lot Georgie Brownbie, the vagabond, was the
      worst. The eldest son was at this time in prison at Brisbane, having on
      some late occasion been less successful than usual in regard to some
      acquired bullocks. The three youngest were at home&mdash;Jerry, Jack, and
      Joe. Tom, who was in prison, was the only stanch friend to the father, who
      consequently at this time was in a more than usually depressed condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas-day would fall on a Tuesday, and on the Monday before it Jerry
      Brownbie, the eldest of those now at home, was sitting, with a pipe in his
      mouth, on a broken-down stool on the broken-down veranda of the house, and
      the old man was seated on a stuffy, worn-out sofa with three legs, which
      was propped against the wall of the house, and had not been moved for
      years. Old Brownbie was a man of gigantic frame, and had possessed immense
      personal power&mdash;a man, too, of will and energy; but he was now worn
      out and dropsical, and could not move beyond the confines of the home
      station. The veranda was attached to a big room which ran nearly the whole
      length of the house, and which was now used for all purposes. There was an
      exterior kitchen, in which certain processes were carried on&mdash;such as
      salting stolen mutton and boiling huge masses of meat, when such work was
      needed. But the cookery was generally done in the big room. And here also
      two or three of the sons slept on beds made upon stretchers along the
      wall. They were not probably very particular as to which owned each bed,
      enjoying a fraternal communism in that respect. At the end of this chamber
      the old man had a room of his own. Boolabong was certainly a miserable
      place; and yet, such as it was, it was frequented by many guests. The
      vagabondism of the colonies is proverbial. Vagabonds are taken in almost
      every where throughout the bush. But the welcome given to them varies.
      Sometimes they are made to work before they are fed&mdash;to their
      infinite disgust. But no such cruelty was exercised at Boolabong.
      Boolabong was a very Paradise for vagabonds. There was always flour and
      meat to be had, generally tobacco, and sometimes even the luxury of a
      nobbler. The Brownbies were wise enough to have learned that it was
      necessary for their very existence that they should have friends in the
      land. On the Sunday the father and Jerry Brownbie were sitting out in the
      veranda at about noon, and the other two sons, Jack and Joe, were lying
      asleep on the beds within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat of the day was intense. There was a wind blowing, but it was that
      which is called there the hot wind, which comes dry, scorching, sometimes
      almost intolerable, over the burning central plain of the country. No one
      can understand without feeling it how much a wind can add to the
      sufferings inflicted by heat. The old man had on a dirty, wretched remnant
      of a dressing-gown, but Jerry was clothed simply in trowsers and an old
      shirt. Only that the mosquitoes would have flayed him, he would have
      dispensed probably with these. He had been quarreling with his father
      respecting a certain horse which he had sold, of the price of which the
      father demanded a share. Jerry had unblushingly declared that he himself
      had &ldquo;shaken&rdquo; the horse&mdash;Anglice, had stolen him&mdash;twelve
      months since on Darnley Downs, and was therefore clearly entitled to the
      entire plunder. The father had rejoined with animation that unless &ldquo;half
      a quid&rdquo;&mdash;or ten shillings&mdash;were given him as his
      contribution to the keep of the animal, he would inform against his son to
      the squatter on the Darnley Downs, and had shown him that he knew the very
      run from which the horse had been taken. Then the sons within had
      interfered from their beds, swearing that their father was the noisiest
      old &ldquo;cuss&rdquo; unhung, they having had their necessary slumbers
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the debate was interrupted by the appearance of a man
      outside the veranda. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Jerry, how goes it?&rdquo; asked the
      stranger. &ldquo;What, Bos, is that you? What brings you up to Boolabong?
      I thought you was ringing trees for that young scut at Gangoil? I&rsquo;ll
      be even with him some of these days! He had the impudence to send a man of
      his up here last week looking for sheep-skins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t that soft, Mr. Jerry, was he? Well, I&rsquo;ve
      dropped working for him.&mdash;How are you, Mr. Brownbie? I hope I see you
      finely, Sir. It&rsquo;s stiffish sort of weather, Mr. Brownbie, ain&rsquo;t
      it, Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man grunted out some reply, and then asked Boscobel what he
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just hang about for the day, Mr. Brownbie, and get a
      little grub. You never begrudged a working-man that yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Brownbie again grunted, but said no word of welcome. That, however,
      was to be taken for granted, without much expression of opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Jerry,&rdquo; continued Boscobel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done
      with that fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so has Nokes done with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nokes is at work on Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill. That sugar business
      wouldn&rsquo;t suit me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An axe in your hand is what you&rsquo;re fit for, Bos.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a many things I can turn my hand to, Mr. Jerry. You
      couldn&rsquo;t give a fellow such a thing as a nobbler, Mr. Jerry, could
      you? I&rsquo;d offer money for it, only I know it would be taken amiss. It&rsquo;s
      that hot that a fellow&rsquo;s very in&rsquo;ards get parched up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Jerry slowly rose, and going to a cupboard, brought forth a
      modicum of spirits, which he called Battle-Axe, but which was supposed to
      be brandy. This Boscobel swallowed at a gulp, and then washed it down with
      a little water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Jerry,&rdquo; said the old man, somewhat relenting in his
      wrath, &ldquo;you might as well give us a drop, as it&rsquo;s going about.&rdquo;
      The two brothers, who had now been thoroughly aroused from their sleep,
      and who had heard the enticing sound of the spirit bottle, joined the
      party, and so they drank all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heathcote&rsquo;s in an awful state about them fires, ain&rsquo;t
      he?&rdquo; asked Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boscobel, who had squatted down on the veranda, and was now lighting his
      pipe, bobbed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he was clean burned out&mdash;over head and ears,&rdquo;
      said Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boscobel bobbed his head again, sucking with great energy at the closely
      staffed pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he treated me like he does you fellows,&rdquo; continued Jerry,
      &ldquo;he shouldn&rsquo;t have a yard of fencing or a blade of grass left&mdash;nor
      a ewe, nor a lamb, nor a hogget. I do hate fellows who come here and want
      to be better than any one about &rsquo;em&mdash;young chaps especially.
      Sending up here to look for sheep-skins, cuss his impudence! I sent that
      German fellow of his away with a flea in his ear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karl Bender?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some such name as that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all in all with the young squire,&rdquo; said Boscobel.
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a chap there called Jacko&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      another. He gets &rsquo;em down there to Gangoil, and the ladies talks to
      &rsquo;em, and then they&rsquo;d go through fire and water for him. There&rsquo;s
      Mickey&mdash;he&rsquo;s another, jist the same way. I don&rsquo;t like
      them ways, myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much of master and man about it, ain&rsquo;t there, Bos?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that, Mr. Jerry. That ain&rsquo;t my idea of a free country. I
      can work as well as another, but I ain&rsquo;t going to be told that I&rsquo;m
      a swindler because I&rsquo;m making the most of my time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He turned Nokes out by the scruff of his neck?&rdquo; said Jerry.
      Boscobel again bobbed his head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think Nokes was the
      sort of fellow to stand that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Boscobel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heathcote&rsquo;s a good plucked un all the same,&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you to speak up for such a fellow is that,&rdquo;
      said Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say he&rsquo;s a good plucked un. I&rsquo;m not standing up for
      him. Nokes is half a stone heavier than him, and ought to have knocked him
      over. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve done, wouldn&rsquo;t you,
      Bos? I know I would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d &lsquo;ve had my axe at his head,&rdquo; said Boscobel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all know Joe&rsquo;s game to the backbone,&rdquo; said Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m game enough for you, anyway,&rdquo; said the brother.
      &ldquo;And you can try it out any time you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; fight like dogs, do,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarrel at this point was interrupted by the arrival of another man,
      who crept up round the corner on to the veranda exactly as Boscobel had
      done. This was Nokes, of whom they had that moment been speaking. There
      was silence for a few moments among them, as though they feared that he
      might have heard them, and Nokes stood hanging his head as though half
      ashamed of himself. Then they gave him the same kind of greeting as the
      other men had received. Nobody told him that he was welcome, but the
      spirit jar was again brought into use, Jerry measuring out the liquor, and
      it was understood that Nokes was to stay there and get his food. He too
      gave some account of himself, which was supposed to suffice, but which
      they all knew to be false. It was Sunday, and they were off work at the
      sugar-mill. He had come across Gangoil run, intending to take back with
      him things of his own which he had left as Bender&rsquo;s hut, and having
      come so far, had thought that he would come on and get his dinner at
      Boolabong. As this was being told, a good deal was said of Harry
      Heathcote. Nokes declared that he had come right across Gangoil, and
      explained that he would not have been at all sorry to meet Master
      Heathcote in the bush. Master Heathcote had had his own way up at the
      station when he was backed by a lot of his own hands; but a good time was
      coming, perhaps. Then Nokes gave it to be understood very plainly that it
      was the settled practice of his life to give Harry Heathcote a thrashing.
      During all this there was an immense amount of bad language, and a large
      portion of the art which in the colony is called &ldquo;blowing.&rdquo;
      Jerry, Boscobel, and Nokes all boasted, each that on the first occasion he
      would give Harry Heathcote such a beating that a whole bone should hardly
      be left in the man&rsquo;s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one of you man enough to touch him,&rdquo; said
      Joe, who was known as the freest fighter of the Brownbie family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d eat him, I suppose,&rdquo; said Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not likely to come in my way,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;but
      if he does, he&rsquo;ll get as good as he brings. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was unpleasant to the visitors, who, of course, felt themselves to be
      snubbed. Boscobel affected to hear the slight put upon his courage with
      good humor, but Nokes laid himself down in a corner and sulked. They were
      soon all asleep, and remained dozing, snoring, changing their
      uncomfortable positions, and cursing the mosquitoes, till about four in
      the afternoon, when Boscobel got up, shook himself, and made some
      observation about &ldquo;grub.&rdquo; The meal of the day was then
      prepared. A certain quantity of flour and raw meat, ample for their
      immediate wants, was given to the two strangers, with which they retired
      into the outer kitchen, prepared it for themselves, and there ate their
      dinner, and each of the brothers did the same for himself in the big room&mdash;Joe,
      the fighting brother, providing for his father&rsquo;s wants as well as
      his own. One of them had half a leg of cold mutton, so that he was saved
      the trouble of cooking, but he did not offer to share this comfort with
      the others. An enormous kettle of tea was made, and that was common among
      them. While this was being consumed, Boscobel put his head into the room,
      and suggested that he and his mate wanted a drink. Whereupon Jerry,
      without a word, pointed to the kettle, and Boscobel was allowed to fill
      two pannikins. Such was the welcome which was always accorded to strangers
      in Boolabong.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their meal the men came back on to the veranda, and there were more
      smoking and sleeping, more boasting and snarling. Different allusions were
      made to the spirit jar, especially by the old man; but they were made in
      vain. The &ldquo;Battle-Axe&rdquo; was Jerry&rsquo;s own property, and he
      felt that he had already been almost foolishly liberal. But he had an
      object in view. He was quite sure that Boscobel and Nokes had not come to
      Boolabong on the same Sunday by any chance coincidence. The men had
      something to propose, and in their own way they would make the proposition
      before they left, and would make it probably to him. Boscobel intended to
      sleep at Boolabong, but Nokes had explained that it was his purpose to
      return that night to Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill. The proposition no doubt would
      be made soon&mdash;a little after seven, when the day was preparing to
      give way suddenly to night. Nokes first walked off, sloping out from the
      veranda in a half-shy, half-cunning manner, looking nowhither, and saying
      a word to no one. Quickly after him Boscobel jumped up suddenly, hitched
      up his trowsers, and followed the first man. At about a similar interval
      Jerry passed out through the big room to the yard at the back, and from
      the yard to a shed that was used as a shambles. Here he found the other
      two men, and no doubt the proposition was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something up,&rdquo; said the old man, as soon as
      Jerry was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s something up,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Those
      fellows didn&rsquo;t come all the way to Boolabong for nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something about young Heathcote,&rdquo; suggested the
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get themselves hanged, that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be blowed,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;you go easy and hold your
      tongue. If you know nothing, nobody can hurt you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t mean. If I
      had scores to quit with a fellow like Harry Heathcote, I should do it
      after my own fashion. I shouldn&rsquo;t get Boscobel to help me, nor yet
      such a fellow as Nokes. But it&rsquo;s no business of mine. Heathcote&rsquo;s
      made the place too hot to hold him. That&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;
      There was no more said, and in an hour&rsquo;s time Jerry returned, to the
      family. Neither the father nor brother asked him any questions, nor did he
      volunteer any information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boolabong was about fourteen miles from Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill. Nokes had
      walked this distance in the morning, and now retraced it at night&mdash;not
      going right across Gangoil, as he had falsely boasted of doing early in
      the day, but skirting it, and keeping on the outside of the fence nearly
      the whole distance. At about two in the morning he reached his cottage
      outside the mill on the river-bank; but he was unable to skulk in unheard.
      Some dogs made a noise, and presently he heard a voice calling him from
      the house. &ldquo;Is that you, Nokes, at this time of night?&rdquo; asked
      Mr. Medlicot. Nokes grunted out some reply, intending to avoid any further
      question. But his master came up to the hut door and asked him where he
      had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just amusing myself,&rdquo; said Nokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not later for me than for you, Mr. Medlicot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve just ridden home from
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Gangoil? I didn&rsquo;t know you were so friendly there, Mr.
      Medlicot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to Gangoil, anyway. Good-night, Mr. Medlicot.&rdquo; Then the
      man took himself into his hut, and was safe from further questioning that
      night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; &ldquo;I WISH YOU&rsquo;D LIKE ME.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the Saturday night Heathcote had been on the run, and he did not
      return home to bed till nearly dawn on the Sunday morning. At about noon
      prayers were read out on the veranda, the congregation consisting of Mrs.
      Heathcote and her sister, Mrs. Growler, and Jacko. Harry himself was
      rather averse to this performance, intimating that Mrs. Growler, if she
      were so minded, could read the prayers for herself in the kitchen, and
      that, as regarded Jacko, they would be altogether thrown away. But his
      wife had made a point of maintaining the practice, and he had of course
      yielded. The service was not long, and when it was over Harry got into a
      chair and was soon asleep. He had been in the saddle during sixteen hours
      of the previous day and night, and was entitled to be fatigued. His wife
      sat beside him, every now and again protecting him from the flies, while
      Kate Daly sat by with her Bible in her hand. But she, too, from time to
      time, was watching her brother-in-law. The trouble of his spirits and the
      work that he felt himself bound to do touched them with a strong feeling,
      and taught them to regard him for the time as a young hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How quietly he sleeps!&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;The fatigue of the
      last week must have been terrible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is quite, quite knocked up,&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t knocked up a bit,&rdquo; said Harry, jumping up from
      his chair. &ldquo;What should knock me up? I wasn&rsquo;t asleep, was I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just dozing, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well; there isn&rsquo;t any thing to do, and it&rsquo;s too hot
      to get out. I wonder Old Bates didn&rsquo;t come in for prayers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he cares much for prayers,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Heathcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he likes an excuse for a nobbler as well as any one. Did I tell
      you that they had fires over at Jackson&rsquo;s yesterday&mdash;at
      Goolaroo?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there any harm done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A deal of grass burned, and they had to drive the sheep, which won&rsquo;t
      serve them this kind of weather. I don&rsquo;t know which I fear most&mdash;the
      grass, the fences, or the sheep. As for the buildings, I don&rsquo;t think
      they&rsquo;ll try that again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Harry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The risk of being seen is too great. I can hardly understand that a
      man like Nokes should have been such a fool as he was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it was Nokes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, certainly. In the first place, Jacko is as true as steel. I
      don&rsquo;t mean to swear by the boy, though I think he is a good boy. But
      I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s true in this. And then the man&rsquo;s manner to
      myself was conclusive. I can not understand a man in Medlicot&rsquo;s
      position supporting a fellow like that. By Heavens! it nearly drives me
      mad to think of it. Thousands and thousands of pounds are at stake. All
      that a man has in the world is exposed to the malice of a scoundrel like
      Nokes! And then a man who calls himself a gentleman will talk about it
      being un-English to look after him. He&rsquo;s a &lsquo;new chum;&rsquo; I
      suppose that&rsquo;s his excuse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a sufficient excuse, you should excuse him,&rdquo;
      said Kate, with good feminine logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you all over. He&rsquo;s good-looking, and
      therefore it&rsquo;s all right. He ought to have learned better. He ought,
      at any rate, to believe that men who have been here much longer than he
      has must know the ways of the country a great deal better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Christmas-time, Harry,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;and
      you should endeavor to forgive your neighbors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a Christmas will it be if you and I, and these young
      fellows here, and Kate, are all burned out of Gangoil? Here&rsquo;s Bates.&mdash;Well,
      Mr. Bates, how goes it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tremendous hot, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found that out already. You haven&rsquo;t heard where
      that fellow Boscobel has gone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I haven&rsquo;t heard. But he&rsquo;ll be over with some of
      those Brownbie lads. They say Georgie Brownbie&rsquo;s about the country
      somewhere. If so, there&rsquo;ll be a row among &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When thieves fall out, Mr. Bates, honest men come by their own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they say, Mr. Heathcote. All the same, I shouldn&rsquo;t care
      how far Georgie was away from any place I had to do with.&rdquo; Then the
      young master and his old superintendent sauntered out to his back premises
      to talk about sheep and fires, and plans for putting out fires. And no
      doubt Mr. Bates had the glass of brandy-and-water which he had come to
      regard as one of his Sunday luxuries. From the back premises they went
      down to the creek to gauge the water. Then they sauntered on, keeping
      always in the shade, sitting down here to smoke, and standing up there to
      discuss the pedigree of some particular ram, till it was past six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well come in and dine with us, Mr. Bates,&rdquo; Harry
      suggested, as they returned toward the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bates said that he thought that he would. As the same invitation was
      given on almost every Sunday throughout the year, and was invariably
      answered in the same way, there was not much excitement in this. But Mr.
      Bates would not have dreamed of going in to dinner without being asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Medlicot&rsquo;s trap,&rdquo; said Mr. Bates, as they
      entered the yard. &ldquo;I heard wheels when they were in the horse
      paddock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry looked at the trap, and then went quickly into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked with a rapid step onto the veranda, and there he found the sugar
      grower and his mother. Mrs. Heathcote looked at her husband almost
      timidly. She knew from the very sound of his feet that he was perturbed in
      spirit. Under his own roof-tree he would certainly be courteous; but there
      is a constrained courtesy very hard to be borne, of which she knew him to
      be capable. He first went up to the old lady, and to her his greeting was
      pleasant enough. Harry Heathcote, though he had assumed the bush mode of
      dressing, still retained the manners of a high-bred gentleman in his
      intercourse with women. Then, turning sharply round, he gave his hand to
      Mr. Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you at Gangoil,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I was not
      fortunate enough to be at home when you called the other day. Mrs.
      Medlicot must have found the drive very hot, I fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was still looking into his face, and was reading there, as in a
      book, the mingled pride and disdain with which her husband exercising
      civility to his enemy. Harry&rsquo;s countenance wore a look not difficult
      of perusal, and Medlicot could read the lines almost as distinctly as
      Harry&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked Mrs. Medlicot to stay and dine with us,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;so that she may have it cool for the drive back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am almost afraid of the bush at night,&rdquo; said the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a full moon,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;it will be
      as light as day.&rdquo; So that was settled. Heathcote thought it odd that
      the man whom he regarded as his enemy, whom he had left at their last
      meeting in positive hostility, should consent to accept a dinner under his
      roof; but that was Medlicot&rsquo;s affair, not his.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined at seven, and after dinner strolled out into the horse paddock,
      and down to the creek. As they started, the three men went first, and the
      ladies followed them; but Bates soon dropped behind. It was his rest day,
      and he had already moved quite as much as was usual with him on a Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I was a little hard with you the other day,&rdquo; said
      Medlicot, when they were alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we hardly understand each other&rsquo;s ideas,&rdquo;
      said Harry. He spoke with a constrained voice, and with an almost savage
      manner, engendered by a determination to hold his own. He would forgive
      any offense for which an apology was made, but no apology had been made as
      yet; and, to tell the truth, he was a little afraid that if they got into
      an argument on the matter Medlicot would have the best of it. And there
      was, too, almost a claim to superiority in Medlicot&rsquo;s use of the
      word &ldquo;hard.&rdquo; When one man says that he has been hard to
      another, he almost boasts that, on that occasion, he got the better of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Medlicot; &ldquo;we do not quite
      understand each other. But we might believe in each other all the same,
      and then the understanding would come. But it isn&rsquo;t just that which
      I want to say; such talking rarely does any good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may perhaps be right about that man Nokes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt I may. I know I&rsquo;m right. When I asked him whether he&rsquo;d
      been at my shed, what made him say that he hadn&rsquo;t been there at
      night-time? I said nothing about night-time. But the man was there at
      night-time, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have used the word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that that is evidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not in England, Mr. Medlicot, but it&rsquo;s good enough
      evidence for the bush. And what made him pretend he didn&rsquo;t know the
      distances? And why can&rsquo;t he look a man in the face? And why should
      the boy have said it was he if it wasn&rsquo;t? Of course, if you think
      well of him you&rsquo;re right to keep him. But you may take it as a rule
      out here that when a man has been dismissed it hasn&rsquo;t been done for
      nothing. Men treated that way should travel out of the country. It&rsquo;s
      better for all parties. It isn&rsquo;t here as it is at home, where people
      live so thick together that nothing is thought of a man being dismissed. I
      was obliged to discharge him, and now he&rsquo;s my enemy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man may be your enemy without being a felon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he may. I&rsquo;m his enemy in a way, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      hurt a hair of his head unjustly. When I see the attempts made to burn me
      out, of course I know that an enemy has been at work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no one else has got a grudge against you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was silent for a moment. What right had this man to cross-examine
      him about his enmities&mdash;the man whose own position in the place had
      been one of hostility to him, whom he had almost suspected of harboring
      Nokes at the mill simply because Nokes had been dismissed from Gangoil?
      That suspicion was, indeed, fading away. There was something in Medlicot&rsquo;s
      voice and manner which made it impossible to attribute such motives to
      him. Nevertheless the man was a free-selector, and had taken a bit of the
      Gangoil run after a fashion which to Heathcote was objectionable
      politically, morally, and socially. Let Medlicot in regard to character be
      what he might, he was a free-selector, and a squatter&rsquo;s enemy, and
      had clinched his hostility by employing a servant dismissed from the very
      run out of which he had bought his land. &ldquo;It is hard to say,&rdquo;
      he replied at length, &ldquo;who have grudges, as against whom, or why. I
      suppose I have a great grudge against you, if the truth is to be known;
      but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t burn down your mill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor yet say worse of you behind your back than I will to your face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think that you have occasion to speak ill
      of me, either one way or the other. What I mean is this&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      quite think that the evidence against Nokes is strong enough to justify me
      in sending him away; but I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on him as well as I can.
      It seems that he left our place early this morning; but the men are not
      supposed to be there on Sundays, and of course he does as he pleases with
      himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation then dropped, and in a little time Harry made some excuse
      for leaving them, and returned to the house alone, promising, however,
      that he would not start for his night&rsquo;s ride till after the party
      had come back to the station. &ldquo;There is no hurry at all,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t stir for two hours yet, but Mickey will be
      waiting there for stores for himself and the German.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means a nobbler for Mickey,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;Either of
      those men would think it a treat to ride ten miles in and ten miles back,
      with a horse-load of sugar and tea and flour, for the sake of a glass of
      brandy-and-water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so would you,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;if you lived in a hut
      by yourself for a fortnight, with nothing to drink but tea without milk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady and Mrs. Heathcote were soon seated on the grass, while
      Medlicot and Kate Daly roamed on together. Kate was a pretty, modest girl,
      timid withal and shy, unused to society, and therefore awkward, but with
      the natural instincts and aptitudes of her sex. What the glass of
      brandy-and-water was to Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd after a fortnight&rsquo;s
      solitude in a bush hut, with tea, dampers, and lumps of mutton, a young
      man in the guise of a gentleman was to poor Kate Daly. A brother-in-law,
      let him be ever so good, is after all no better than tea without milk. No
      doubt Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd often thought about a nobbler in his thirsty
      solitude, and so did Kate speculate on what might possibly be the
      attractions of a lover. Medlicot probably indulged in no such
      speculations; but the nobbler, when brought close to his lips, was
      grateful to him as to others. That Kate Daly was very pretty no man could
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it sad that he should have to ride about all night like
      that?&rdquo; said Kate, to whom, as was proper, Harry Heathcote at the
      present moment was of more importance than any other human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he likes it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Mr. Medlicot; how can he like it? It is not the hard work he
      minds, but the constant dread of coming evil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The excitement keeps him alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty on a station to keep a man alive in that way
      at all times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And plenty to keep ladies alive too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ladies! I don&rsquo;t know that ladies have any business in the
      bush. Harry&rsquo;s trouble is all about my sister and the children and
      me. He wouldn&rsquo;t care a straw for himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;d be better without a wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;Well, no. I suppose it would be very
      rough without Mary; and he&rsquo;d be so lonely when he came in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nobody to make his tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to look after his things,&rdquo; said Kate, earnestly. &ldquo;I
      know it was very rough before we came here. He says that himself. There
      were no regular meals, but just food in a cupboard when he chose to get
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not comfortable, certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrid, I should think. I suppose it is better for him to be
      married. You&rsquo;ve got your mother, Mr. Medlicot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: I&rsquo;ve got my mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes a difference, does it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very great difference. She&rsquo;ll save me from having to go to
      a cupboard for my bread and meat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose having a woman about is better for a man. They haven&rsquo;t
      got any thing else to do, and therefore they can look to things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you help to look to things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I do something. I often feel ashamed to think how very
      little it is. As for that, I&rsquo;m not wanted at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you&rsquo;re free to go elsewhere?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, Mr. Medlicot; only I know I&rsquo;m not
      of much use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you had a house of your own?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gangoil is my home just as much as it is Mary&rsquo;s; and I
      sometimes feel that Harry is just as good to me as he is to Mary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister will never leave Gangoil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless Harry gets another station.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will have to be transplanted some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate merely chucked up her head and pouted her lips, as though to show
      that the proposition was one which did not deserve an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry a squatter, of course, Miss Daly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever marry any body, Mr. Medlicot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t marry any one but a squatter? I can quite
      understand that. The squatters here are what the lords and the country
      gentlemen are at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even picture to myself what sort of life people live
      at home.&rdquo; Both Medlicot and Kate Daly meant England when they spoke
      of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t so much difference as people think. Classes hang
      together just in the same way; only I think there&rsquo;s a little more
      exclusiveness here than there was there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to this, Kate asserted with innocent eagerness that she was not
      at all exclusive, and that if ever she married any one she&rsquo;d marry
      the man she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d like me,&rdquo; said Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; said Kate, in a low, timid whisper,
      hurrying away to rejoin the other ladies. She could speculate on the
      delights of the beverage as would Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd in his hut; but when
      it was first brought to her lips she could only fly away from it. In this
      respect Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd was the more sensible of the two. No other
      word was spoken that night between them, but Kate lay awake till morning
      thinking of the one word that had been spoken. But the secret was kept
      sacredly within her own bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Medlicots started that night the old lady made a proposition
      that the Heathcotes and Miss Daly should eat the Christmas dinner at
      Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill. Mrs. Heathcote, thinking perhaps of her sister,
      thoroughly liking what she herself had seen of the Medlicots, looked
      anxiously into Harry&rsquo;s face. If he would consent to this, an
      intimacy would follow, and probably a real friendship be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of the question,&rdquo; he said. The very firmness,
      however, with which he spoke gave a certain cordiality even to his
      refusal. &ldquo;I must be at home, so that the men may know where to find
      me till I go out for the night.&rdquo; Then, after a pause, he continued,
      &ldquo;As we can&rsquo;t go to you, why should you not come to us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was at last decided, much to Harry&rsquo;s own astonishment, much to
      his wife&rsquo;s delight. Kate, therefore, when she lay awake, thinking of
      the one word that had been spoken, knew that there would be an opportunity
      for another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot drove his mother home safely, and, after he had taken her into
      the house, encountered Nokes on his return from Boolabong, as has been
      told at the close of the last chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; &ldquo;I DO WISH HE WOULD COME!&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the Monday morning Harry came home as usual, and, as usual, went to bed
      after his breakfast. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care about the heat if it
      were not for the wind,&rdquo; he said to his wife, as he threw himself
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind carries it so, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and it comes from just the wrong side&mdash;from the
      northwest. There have been half a dozen fires about to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the night, you mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; yesterday&mdash;Sunday. I can not make out whether they come by
      themselves. They certainly are not all made by incendiaries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accidents, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. Somebody drops a match, and the sun ignites it. But the
      chances are much against a fire like that spreading. Care is wanted to
      make it spread. As far as I can learn, the worst fires have not been just
      after midday, when, of course, the heat is greater, but in the early
      night, before the dews have come. All the same, I feel that I know nothing
      about it&mdash;nothing at all. Don&rsquo;t let me sleep long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this injunction, Mrs. Heathcote determined that he should
      sleep all day if he would. Even the nights were fearfully hot and sultry,
      and on this Monday morning he had come home much fatigued. He would be out
      again at sunset, and now he should have what rest nature would allow him.
      But in this resolve she was opposed by Jacko, who came in at eleven, and
      requested to see the master. Jacko had been over with the German; and, as
      he explained to Mrs. Heathcote, they two had been in and out, sometimes
      sleeping and sometimes watching. But now he wanted to see the master, and
      under no persuasion would impart his information to the mistress. The poor
      wife, anxious as she was that her husband should sleep, did not dare in
      these perilous times to ignore Jacko and his information, and therefore
      gently woke the sleeper. In a few minutes Jacko was standing by the young
      squatter&rsquo;s bedside, and Harry Heathcote, quite awake, was sitting up
      and listening. &ldquo;George Brownbie&rsquo;s at Boolabong.&rdquo; That at
      first was the gravamen of Jacko&rsquo;s news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that already, Jacko.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; exclaimed Jacko. In those parts Georgie Brownbie
      was regarded almost as the Evil One himself, and Jacko, knowing what
      mischief was, as it were, in the word, thought that he was entitled to
      bread and jam, if not to a nobbler itself, in bringing such tidings to
      Gangoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Heathcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bos is at Boolabong, and Bill Nokes was there all Sunday, and
      Jerry Brownbie&rsquo;s been out with Bos and Georgie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man wouldn&rsquo;t say any thing of that kind, Jacko.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man! He knows nothing about it. My word! they don&rsquo;t
      tell him about nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Tom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s away in prison. They always cotches the best when they
      want to send &rsquo;em to prison. If they&rsquo;d lock up Jerry and
      Georgie and Jack! My word! yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;re arranging it all at Boolabong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In course they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Boscobel shouldn&rsquo;t be at Boolabong
      without intending me any harm. Of course he&rsquo;d go there when he left
      Gangoil. That&rsquo;s where they all go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bill Nokes, Mr. Harry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bill Nokes too. Though why he should travel so far from his
      work this weather I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! no, Mr. Harry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see any fires about your way last night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacko shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go into the kitchen and get something to eat, and wait for me.
      I shall be out before long now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Heathcote had made light of the assemblage of evil spirits at
      Boolabong which had seemed so important to Jacko, he by no means did
      regard the news as unessential. Of Nokes&rsquo;s villany he was convinced.
      Of Boscobel he had imprudently made a second enemy at a most inauspicious
      time. Georgie Brownbie had long been his bitter foe. He had prosecuted
      and, perhaps, persecuted Georgie for various offenses; but as Georgie was
      supposed to be as much at war with his own brethren as with the rest of
      the world at large, Heathcote had not thought much of that miscreant in
      the present emergency. But if the miscreant were in truth at Boolabong,
      and if evil things were being plotted against Gangoil, Georgie would
      certainly be among the conspirators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after noon Harry was on horseback and Jacko was at his heels. The
      heat was more intense than ever. Mrs. Heathcote had twisted round Harry&rsquo;s
      hat a long white scarf, called a puggeree, though we are by no means sure
      of our spelling. Jacko had spread a very dirty fragment of an old white
      handkerchief on his head, and wore his hat over it. Mrs. Heathcote had
      begged Harry to take a large cotton parasol, and he had nearly consented,
      being unable at last to reconcile himself to the idea of riding with such
      an accoutrement even in the bush. &ldquo;The heat&rsquo;s a bore,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid of it as long as I keep
      moving. Yes, I&rsquo;ll be back to dinner, though I won&rsquo;t say when,
      and I won&rsquo;t say for how long. It will be the same thing all day
      to-morrow. I wish with all my heart those people were not coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode straight away to the German&rsquo;s hut, which was on the
      northwestern extremity of his further paddock in that direction. From
      thence the western fence ran in a southerly direction, nearly straight to
      the river. Beyond the fence was a strip of land, in some parts over a mile
      broad, in others not much over a quarter of a mile, which he claimed as
      belonging to Gangoil, but over which the Brownbies had driven their cattle
      since the fence had been made, under the pretense that the fence marked
      the boundary of two runs. Against this assumption Heathcote had
      remonstrated frequently, had driven the cattle back, and had exercised the
      ownership of a Crown tenant in such fashion as the nature of his
      occupation allowed. Beyond this strip was Boolabong; the house at
      Boolabong being not above three miles distant from the fence, and not
      above four miles from the German&rsquo;s hut. So that the Brownbies were
      in truth much nearer neighbors to the German than was Heathcote and his
      family. But between the German and the Brownbies there raged an
      internecine feud. No doubt Harry Heathcote, in his heart, liked the German
      all the better on this account; but it behooved him both as a master and a
      magistrate to regard reports against Boolabong coming from the German with
      something of suspicion. Now Jacko had been introduced to Gangoil under
      German auspices, and had soon come to a decision that it would be a good
      thing and a just to lock up all the Brownbies in the great jail of the
      colony at Brisbane. He probably knew nothing of law or justice in the
      abstract, but he greatly valued law when exercised against those he hated.
      The western fence of which mention has been made ran down to the Mary
      River, hitting it about four miles west of Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill; so that
      there was a considerable portion of the Gangoil run having a frontage to
      the water. As has been before said, Medlicot&rsquo;s plantation was about
      fourteen miles distant from the house at Boolabong, and the distance from
      the Gangoil house to that of the Brownbies was about the same.

      The oppressiveness of the day was owing more to the hot wind than to the
      sun itself. This wind, coming from the arid plains of the interior,
      brought with it a dry, suffocating heat. On this occasion it was odious to
      Harry Heathcote, not so much on account of its own intrinsic abominations,
      as because it might cause a fire to sweep across his run from its western
      boundary. Just beyond the boundary there lay Boolabong, and there were
      collected his enemies. A fire that should have passed for a mile or so
      across the pastures outside and beyond his own farm would be altogether
      unextinguishable by the time that it had reached his paddock. The
      Brownbies, as he knew well, would care nothing for burning a patch of
      their own grass. Their stock, if they had any at the present moment, were
      much too few in number to be affected by such a loss. The Brownbies had
      not a yard of fencing to be burned; and a fire, if once it got a hold on
      the edge of their run, would pass on away from them, right across Harry&rsquo;s
      pastures and Harry&rsquo;s fences. If such were the case, he would have
      quite enough to do to drive his sheep from the fire, and it might be that
      many of them also would perish in the flames. The catastrophe might even
      be so bad, so frightful, that the shed and station and all should go;
      though, in thinking of all the fires of which he had heard, he could
      remember none that had spread with fatality such as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Karl Bender in his hut asleep. The man was soon up, apologizing
      for his somnolence, and preparing tea for his master&rsquo;s
      entertainment. &ldquo;It is not Christmas like at home at all; is it, Mr.
      ‘Eathcote? Dear, no! Them red divils is there ready to give us a Christmas
      roasting.&rdquo; Then he told how he had boldly ridden up to Boolabong
      that morning, and had seen Georgie and Boscobel with his own eyes. When
      asked what they had said to him, he replied that he did not wait till any
      thing had been said, but had hurried away as fast as his horse could carry
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up to Boolabong myself,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! They&rsquo;ll just about knock your head off,&rdquo;
      suggested Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl Bender also thought that the making of such a visit would be a source
      of danger. But Heathcote explained that any personal attack was not to be
      apprehended from these men. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not their game,&rdquo; he
      said, arguing that men who premeditated a secret outrage would not
      probably be tempted into personal violence. The horror of the position lay
      in this&mdash;that though a fire should rise up almost under the feet of
      men who were known to be hostile to him, and whose characters were
      acknowledged to be bad, still would there be no evidence against them. It
      was known to all men that, at periods of heat such as that which was now
      raging, fires were common. Every day the pastures were in flames, here,
      there, and every where. It was said, indeed, that there existed no
      evidence of fires in the bush till men had come with their flocks. But
      then there had been no smoking, no boiling of pots, no camping out, till
      men had come, and no matches. Every one around might be sure that some
      particular fire had been the work of an incendiary, might be able to name
      the culprit who had done the deed; and yet no jury could convict the
      miscreant. Watchfulness was the best security, watchfulness day and night
      till rain should come; and Heathcote calculated that it would be better
      for him that his enemies should know that he was watchful. He would go up
      among them and show them that he was not ashamed to speak to them of his
      anxiety. They could hear nothing by his coming which they did not already
      know. They were well aware that he was on the watch, and it might be well
      that they should know also how close his watch was kept. He took the
      German and Jacko with him, but left them with their horses about a mile on
      the Boolabong side of his own fence, nigh to the extreme boundary of the
      Debatable Land. They knew his whistle, and were to ride to him at once
      should he call them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left the house about noon, saying that he would be home to dinner&mdash;which,
      however, on such occasions, was held to be a feast movable over a wide
      space of time. But on this occasion the women expected him to come early,
      as it was his intention to be out again as soon as it should be dark. Mrs.
      Growler was asked to have the dinner ready at six. During the day Mrs.
      Heathcote was backward and forward in the kitchen. Then was something
      wrong she knew, but could not quite discern the evil. Sing Sing, the cook,
      was more than ordinarily alert; but Sing Sing, the cook, was not much
      trusted. Mrs. Growler was &ldquo;as good as the Bank,&rdquo; as far as
      that went, having lived with old Mr. Daly when he was prosperous; but she
      was apt to be downhearted, and on the present occasion was more than
      usually low in spirits. Whenever Mrs. Heathcote spoke, she wept. At six o&rsquo;clock
      she came into the parlor with a budget of news. Sing Sing, the cook, had
      been gone for the last half hour, leaving the leg of mutton at the fire.
      It soon became clear to them that he had altogether absconded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them rats always does leave a falling house,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Growler.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock the sun was down, though the gloom of the tropical
      evening had not yet come. The two ladies went out to the gate, which was
      but a few yards from the veranda, and there stood listening for the sound
      of Harry&rsquo;s horse. The low moaning of the wind through the trees
      could be heard, but it was so gentle, continuous, and unaltered that it
      seemed to be no more than a vehicle for other sounds, and was as
      death-like as silence itself. The gate of the horse paddock through which
      Heathcote must pass on his way home was nearly a mile distant; but the
      road there was hard, and they knew that they could hear from there the
      fall of his horse&rsquo;s feet. There they stood from seven to nearly
      eight, whispering a word now and then to each other, listening always, but
      in vain. Looking away to the west every now and then, they fancied that
      they could see the sky glow with flames, and then they would tell each
      other that it was fancy. The evening grew darker and still darker, but no
      sound was heard through the moaning wind. From time to time Mrs. Growler
      came out to them, declaring her fears in no measured terms. &ldquo;Well,
      marm, I do declare I think we&rsquo;d better go away out of this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, Mrs. Growler! What nonsense! Where can we go to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mill would be nearest, ma&rsquo;am, and we should be safe
      there. I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Medlicot would take us in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you not be safe here?&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wretched Chinese hasn&rsquo;t gone and left us for nothing,
      miss, and what would we three lone women do here if all them Brownbies
      came down upon us? Why don&rsquo;t master come back? He ought to come
      back; oughtn&rsquo;t he, ma&rsquo;am? He never do think what lone women
      are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heathcote took her husband&rsquo;s part very strongly, and gave Mrs.
      Growler as hard a scolding as she knew how to pronounce. But her own
      courage was giving way much as Mrs. Growler&rsquo;s had done. &ldquo;We
      are bound to stay here,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and if the worst comes, we
      must bear it as others have done before us.&rdquo; Then Mrs. Growler was
      very sulky, and, retreating to the kitchen, sobbed there in solitude.
      &ldquo;Oh, Kate, I do wish he would come,&rdquo; said the elder sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so desolate, and he may be so far off, and we couldn&rsquo;t
      get to him if any thing happened, and we shouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were again silent, and remained without exchanging more than a
      word or two for nearly half an hour. They took hold of each other, and
      every now and then went to the kitchen door that the old woman might be
      comforted by their presence, but they had no consolation to offer each
      other. The silence of the bush, and the feeling of great distances, and
      the dread of calamity almost crushed them. At last there was a distant
      sound of horse&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;I hear him,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Heathcote, rushing forward toward the outer gate of the horse paddock,
      followed by her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ears were true, but she was doomed to disappointment. The horseman was
      only a messenger from her husband&mdash;Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd, the Irish
      boundary rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had great tidings to tell, and was so long telling them that we will
      not attempt to give them in his own words. The purport of his story was as
      follows: Harry had been to Boolabong House, but had found there no one but
      the old man. Returning home thence toward his own fence, he had smelled
      the smoke of fire, and had found within a furlong of his path a long ridge
      of burning grass. According to Mickey&rsquo;s account, it could not have
      been lighted above a few minutes before Heathcote&rsquo;s presence on the
      spot. As it was, it had got too much ahead for him to put it out
      single-handed; a few yards he might have managed, but&mdash;so Mickey
      said, probably exaggerating the matter&mdash;there was half a quarter of a
      mile of flame. He had therefore ridden on before the fire, had called his
      own two men to him, and had at once lighted the grass himself some two
      hundred yards in front, making a second fire, but so keeping it down that
      it should be always under control. Before the hinder flames had caught
      him, Bender and Jacko had been with him, and they had thus managed to
      consume the fuel which, had it remained there, would have fed the fire
      which was too strong to be mastered. By watching the extremities of the
      line of fire, they overpowered it, and so the damage was for the moment at
      an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method of dealing with the enemy was so well known in the bush, and
      had been so often canvassed in the hearing of the two sisters, that it was
      clearly intelligible to them. The evil had been met in the proper way, and
      the remedy had been effective. But why did not Harry come home?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd, after his fashion, explained that too. The ladies
      were not to wait dinner. The master felt himself obliged to remain out at
      night, and had gotten food at the German&rsquo;s hut. He, Mickey, was
      commissioned to return with a flask full of brandy, as it would be
      necessary that Harry, with all the men whom he could trust, should be
      &ldquo;on the rampage&rdquo; all night. This small body was to consist of
      Harry himself, of the German, of Jacko, and, according to the story as at
      present told, especially of Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd. Much as she would have
      wished to have kept the man at the station for protection, she did not
      think of disobeying her husband&rsquo;s orders. So Mickey was fed, and
      then sent back with the flask&mdash;with tidings also as to the desertion
      of that wretched cook, Sing Sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sit here all night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heathcote to her
      sister. &ldquo;As things are, I shall not think of going to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate declared that she would also sit in the veranda all night; and, as a
      matter of course, they were joined by Mrs. Growler. They had been so
      seated about an hour when Kate Daly declared that the heavens were on
      fire. The two young women jumped up, flew to the gate, and found that the
      whole western horizon was lurid with a dark red light.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE BUSH FIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harry Heathcote had on this occasion entertained no doubt whatever that
      the fire had been intentional and premeditated. A lighted torch must have
      been dragged along the grass, so as to ignite a line many yards long all
      at the same time. He had been luckily near enough to the spot to see
      almost the commencement of the burning, and was therefore aware of its
      form and circumstances. He almost wondered that he had not seen the figure
      of the man who had drawn the torch, or at any rate heard his steps.
      Pursuit would have been out of the question, as his work was wanted at the
      moment to extinguish the flames. The miscreant probably had remembered
      this, and had known that he might escape stealthily without the noise of a
      rapid retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the work was over, when he had put out the fire he had himself
      lighted, and had exterminated the lingering remnants of that which had
      been intended to destroy him, he stood still a while almost in despair.
      His condition seemed to be hopeless. What could he do against such a band
      of enemies, knowing as he did that, had he been backed even by a score of
      trusty followers, one foe might still suffice to ruin him? At the present
      moment he was very hot with the work he had done, as were also Jacko and
      the German. O&rsquo;Dowd had also come up as they were completing their
      work. Their mode of extinguishing the flames had been to beat them down
      with branches of gum-tree loaded with leaves. By sweeping these along the
      burning ground the low flames would be scattered and expelled. But the
      work was very hard and hot. The boughs they used were heavy, and the air
      around them, sultry enough from its own properties, was made almost
      unbearable by the added heat of the fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work had been so far done, but it might be begun again at any moment,
      either near or at a distance. No doubt the attempt would be made elsewhere
      along the boundary between Gangoil and Boolabong&mdash;was very probably
      being made at this moment. The two men whom he could trust and Jacko were
      now with him. They were wiping their brows with their arms and panting
      with their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first resolved on sending Mickey O&rsquo;Dowd to the house. The
      distance was great, and the man&rsquo;s assistance might be essential. But
      he could not bear to leave his wife without news from him. Then, after
      considering a while, he made up his mind to go back toward his own fence,
      making his way as he went southerly down toward the river. They who were
      determined to injure him would, he thought, repeat their attempt in that
      direction. He hardly said a word to his two followers, but rode at a
      foot-pace to the spot at his fence which he had selected as the site of
      his bivouac for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be very cheery, Bender,&rdquo; he said to the
      German; &ldquo;but we shall have to make a night of it till they disturb
      us again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The German made a motion with his arms intended to signify his utter
      indifference. One place was the same as another to him. Jacko uttered his
      usual ejaculation, and then, having hitched his horse to the fence, threw
      himself on his back upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt they all slept, but they slept as watchers sleep, with one eye
      open. It was Harry who first saw the light which a few minutes later made
      itself visible to the ladies at the home station. &ldquo;Karl,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, jumping up, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re at it again&mdash;look there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than half a minute, and without speaking another word, they were
      all on their horses and riding in the direction of the light. It came from
      a part of the Boolabong run somewhat nearer to the river than the place at
      which they had stationed themselves, where the strip of ground between
      Harry&rsquo;s fence and the acknowledged boundary of Brownbie&rsquo;s run
      was the narrowest. As they approached the fire, they became aware that it
      had been lighted on Boolabong. On this occasion Harry did not ride on up
      to the flames, knowing that the use or loss of a few minutes might save or
      destroy his property. He hardly spoke a word as he proceeded on his
      business, feeling that they upon whom he had to depend were sufficiently
      instructed, if only they would be sufficiently energetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it well under, but let it run,&rdquo; was all he said, as,
      lighting a dried bush with a match, he ran the fire along the ground in
      front of the coming flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger seeing it all would have felt sure that the remedy would have
      been as bad as the disease, for the fire which Harry himself made every
      now and again seemed to get the better of those who were endeavoring to
      control it. There might perhaps be a quarter of a mile between the front
      of the advancing fire and the line at which Harry had commenced to destroy
      the food which would have fed the coming flames. He himself, as quickly as
      he lighted the grass, which in itself was the work but of a moment, would
      strain himself to the utmost at the much harder task of controlling his
      own fire, so that it should not run away from him, and get, as it were,
      out of his hands, and be as bad to him as that which he was thus seeking
      to circumvent. The German and Jacko worked like heroes, probably with
      intense enjoyment of the excitement, and, after a while, found a fourth
      figure among the flames, for Mickey had now returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw them,&rdquo; Harry said, panting with his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mickey, flopping away with a
      great bough; &ldquo;but that tarnation Chinese has gone off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! Sing Sing. Find him at Boolabong,&rdquo; said Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German, whose gum-tree bough was a very big one, and whose every
      thought was intent on letting the fire run while he still held it in hand,
      had not breath for a syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the back fire was extending itself, so as to get round them. Every now
      and then Harry extended his own line, moving always forward toward Gangoil
      as he did so, though he and his men were always on Brownbie&rsquo;s
      territory. He had no doubt but that where he could succeed in destroying
      the grass for a breadth of forty or fifty yards he would starve out the
      inimical flames. The trees and bushes without the herbage would not enable
      it to travel a yard. Wherever the grass was burned down black to the soil,
      the fire would stop. But should they, who were at work, once allow
      themselves to be outflanked, their exertions would be all in vain. And
      then those wretches might light a dozen fires. The work was so hard, so
      hot, and often so hopeless, that the unhappy young squatter was more than
      once tempted to bid his men desist and to return to his homestead. The
      flames would not follow him there. He could, at any rate, make that safe.
      And then, when he had repudiated this feeling as unworthy of him, he began
      to consider within himself whether he would not do better for his property
      by taking his men with him on to his run, and endeavoring to drive his
      sheep out of danger. But as he thought of all this, he still worked, still
      fired the grass, and still controlled the flames. Presently he became
      aware of what seemed to him at first to be a third fire. Through the
      trees, in the direction of the river, he could see the glimmering of low
      flames and the figures of men. But it was soon apparent to him that these
      men were working in his cause, and that they, too, were burning the grass
      that would have fed the advancing flames. At first he could not spare the
      minute which would be necessary to find out who was his friend, but, as
      they drew nearer, he knew the man. It was the sugar planter from the mill
      and with him his foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been doing our best,&rdquo; said Medlicot, &ldquo;but
      we&rsquo;ve been terribly afraid that the fire would slip away from us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing,&rdquo; said Harry, too much excited at
      the moment to ask questions as to the cause of Medlicot&rsquo;s presence
      so far from his home at that time of the evening. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      getting round us, I&rsquo;m afraid, all the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but it is. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to
      distinguish. How hot the fire makes it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot, indeed!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s killing work for
      men, and then all for no good! To think that men, creatures that call
      themselves men, should do such a thing as this! It breaks one&rsquo;s
      heart.&rdquo; He had paused as he spoke, leaning on the great battered
      bough which he held, but in an instant was at work with it again. &ldquo;Do
      you stay here, Mr. Medlicot, with the men, and I&rsquo;ll go on beyond
      where you began. If I find the fire growing down, I&rsquo;ll shout, and
      they can come to me.&rdquo; So saying, he rushed on with a lighted bush
      torch in his band.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he found himself confronted in the bush by a man on horseback,
      whom he at once recognized as Georgie Brownbie. He forgot for a moment
      where he was and began to question the reprobate as to his presence at
      that spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like your impudence,&rdquo; said Georgie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      not only trespassing, but you&rsquo;re destroying our property willfully,
      and you ask me what business I have here. You&rsquo;re a nice sort of
      young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry, checked for a moment by the remembrance that he was in truth upon
      Boolabong run, did not at once answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that bush down, and don&rsquo;t burn our grass,&rdquo;
      continued Georgie, &ldquo;or you shall have to answer for it. What right
      have you to fire our grass?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who fired it first?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It lighted itself. That&rsquo;s no rule why you should light it
      more. You give over, or I punch your head for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s men and Medlicot were advancing toward him, trampling out
      their own embers as they came; and Georgie Brownbie, who was alone, when
      he saw that there were four or five men against him, turned round and rode
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see impudence like that?&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      probably the very man who set the match, and yet he comes and brazens it
      out with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the man who set the match,&rdquo;
      said Medlicot, quietly; &ldquo;at any rate there was another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My man, Nokes. I saw him with the torch in his hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven and earth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Heathcote. I saw him put it down. You were about right,
      you see, and I was about wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had not a word to say, unless it were tell the man that he loved him
      for the frankness of his confession. But the moment was hardly auspicious
      for such a declaration. There was no excuse for them to pause in their
      work, for the fire was still crackling at their back, and they did no more
      than pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;there it goes; we shall be done at
      last.&rdquo; For he saw that he was being outflanked by the advancing
      flames. But still they worked, drawing lines of fire here and there, and
      still they hoped that there might be ground for hope. Nokes had been seen;
      but, pregnant as the theme might be with words, it was almost impossible
      to talk. Questions could not be asked and answered without stopping in
      their toil. There were questions which Harry longed to ask. Could Medlicot
      swear to the man? Did the man know that he had been seen? If he knew that
      he had been watched while he lit the grass, he would soon be far away from
      Medlicot&rsquo;s Mill and Gangoil. Harry felt that it would be a
      consolation to him in his trouble if he could get hold of this man, and
      keep him, and prosecute him&mdash;and have him hung. Even in the tumult of
      the moment he was able to reflect about it, and to think that he
      remembered that the crime of arson was capital in the colony of
      Queensland. He had endeavored to be good to the men with whom he had
      dealings. He had not stinted their food, or cut them short in their wages,
      or been hard in exacting work from them. And this was his return! Ideas as
      to the excellence of absolute dominion and power flitted across his brain&mdash;such
      power as Abraham, no doubt, exercised. In Abraham&rsquo;s time the people
      were submissive, and the world was happy. Harry Heathcote, at least, had
      never heard that it was not happy. But as he thought of all this he worked
      away with his bush and his matches, extinguishing the flames here and
      lighting them there, striving to make a cordon of black bare ground
      between Boolabong and Gangoil. Surely Abraham had never been called on to
      work like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his men were in a line covering something above a quarter of a mile
      of ground, of which line he was himself the nearest to the river, and
      Medlicot and his foreman the farthest from it. The German and O&rsquo;Dowd
      were in the middle, and Jacko was working with his master. If Harry had
      just cause for anger and sorrow in regard to Nokes and Boscobel, he
      certainly had equal cause to be proud of the stanchness of his remaining
      satellites. The men worked with a will, as though the whole run had been
      the personal property of each of them. Nokes and Boscobel would probably
      have done the same had the fires come before they had quarreled with their
      master. It is a small and narrow point that turns the rushing train to the
      right or to the left. The rushing man is often turned off by a point as
      small and narrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; said Jacko, on a sudden, &ldquo;here they are, all
      o&rsquo; horseback!&rdquo; And as he spoke, there was the sound of half a
      dozen horsemen galloping up to them through the bush. &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s
      Bos, his own self,&rdquo; said Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two leading men were Joe and Jerry Brownbie, who, for this night only,
      had composed their quarrels, and close to them was Boscobel. There were
      others behind, also mounted&mdash;Jack Brownbie and Georgie, and Nokes
      himself; but they, though their figures were seen, could not be
      distinguished in the gloom of the night. Nor, indeed, did Harry at first
      discern of how many the party consisted. It seemed that there was a whole
      troop of horsemen, whose purpose it was to interrupt him in his work, so
      that the flames should certainly go ahead. And it was evident that the men
      thought that they could do so without subjecting themselves to legal
      penalties. As far as Harry Heathcote could see, they were correct in their
      view. He could have no right to burn the grass on Boolabong. He had no
      claim even to be there. It was true that he could plead that he was
      stopping the fire which they had purposely made; but they could prove his
      handiwork, whereas it would be almost impossible that he should prove
      theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole forest was not red, but lurid, with the fires, and the air was
      laden with both the smell and the heat of the conflagration. The horsemen
      were dressed, as was Harry himself, in trowsers and shirts, with old
      slouch hats, and each of them had a cudgel in his hand. As they came
      galloping up through the trees they were as uncanny and unwelcome a set of
      visitors as any man was ever called on to receive. Harry necessarily
      stayed his work, and stood still to bear the brunt of the coming attack;
      but Jacko went on with his employment faster than ever, as though a troop
      of men in the dark were nothing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry Brownbie was the first to speak. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this you&rsquo;re
      up to, Heathcote? Firing our grass? It&rsquo;s arson. You shall swing for
      this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my chance of that,&rdquo; said Harry, turning to
      his work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m blessed if you do. Ride over him, Bos, while I stop
      these other fellows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brownbies had been aware that Harry&rsquo;s two boundary riders were
      with him, but had not heard of the arrival of Medlicot and the other man.
      Nokes was aware that some one on horseback had been near him when he was
      firing the grass, but had thought that it was one of the party from
      Gangoil. By the time that Jerry Brownbie had reached the German, Medlicot
      was there also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce are you?&rdquo; asked Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business is that of yours?&rdquo; said Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No business of mine, and you firing our grass! I&rsquo;ll let you
      know my business pretty quickly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that fellow, Medlicot, from the sugar-mill,&rdquo; said
      Joe; &ldquo;the man that Nokes is with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you was a horse of another color,&rdquo; continued Jerry,
      who had been given to understand that Medlicot was Heathcote&rsquo;s
      enemy. &ldquo;Anyway, I won&rsquo;t have my grass fired. If God A&rsquo;mighty
      chooses to send fires, we can&rsquo;t help it. But I&rsquo;m not going to
      have incendiaries here as well. You&rsquo;re a new chum, and don&rsquo;t
      understand what you&rsquo;re about, but you must stop this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Medlicot still went on putting out the fire, Jerry attempted to ride
      him down. Medlicot caught the horse by the rein, and violently backed the
      brute in among the embers. The animal plunged and reared, getting his head
      loose, and at last came down, he and his rider together. In the mean time
      Joe Brownbie, seeing this, rode up behind the sugar planter, and struck
      him violently with his cudgel over the shoulder. Medlicot sank nearly to
      the ground, but at once recovered himself. He knew that some bone on the
      left side of his body was broken; but he could still fight with his right
      hand, and he did fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boscobel and Georgie Brownbie both attempted to ride over Harry together,
      and might have succeeded had not Jacko ingeniously inserted the burning
      branch of gum-tree with which he had been working under the belly of the
      horse on which Boscobel was riding. The animal jumped immediately from the
      ground, bucking into the air, and Boscobel was thrown far over his head.
      Georgie Brownbie then turned upon Jacko, but Jacko was far too nimble to
      be caught, and escaped among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes the fight was general, but the footmen had the best of
      it, in spite of the injury done to Medlicot. Jerry was bruised and burned
      about the face by his fall among the ashes, and did not much relish the
      work afterward. Boscobel was stunned for a few moments, and was quite
      ready to retreat when he came to himself. Nokes during the whole time did
      not show himself, alleging as a reason afterward the presence of his
      employer Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if your cowardice sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hang you,&rdquo;
      said Joe Brownbie to him on their way home. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re
      going to fight the battles of a fellow like you, who hasn&rsquo;t pluck to
      come forward himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve as much pluck as you,&rdquo; answered Nokes, &ldquo;and
      am ready to fight you any day. But I know when a man is to come forward
      and when he&rsquo;s not. Hang me! I&rsquo;m not so near hanging as some
      folks at Boolabong.&rdquo; We may imagine, therefore, that the night was
      not spent pleasantly among the Brownbies after these adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, of course, very much cursing and swearing, and very many
      threats, before the party from Boolabong did retreat. Their great point
      was, of coarse, this&mdash;that Heathcote was willfully firing the grass,
      and was, therefore, no better than an incendiary. Of course they stoutly
      denied that the original fire had been intentional, and denied as stoutly
      that the original fire could be stopped by fires. But at last they went,
      leaving Heathcote and his party masters of the battle-field. Jerry was
      taken away in a sad condition; and, in subsequent accounts of the
      transaction given from Boolabong, his fall was put forward as the reason
      of their flight, he having been the general on the occasion. And Boscobel
      had certainly lost all stomach for immediate fighting. Immediately behind
      the battle-field they come across Nokes, and Sing Sing, the runaway cook
      from Gangoil. The poor Chinaman had made the mistake of joining the party
      which was not successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harry, though the victory was with him, was hardly in a mood for
      triumph. He soon found that Medlicot&rsquo;s collar-bone was broken, and
      it would be necessary, therefore, that he should return with the wounded
      man to the station. And the flames, as he feared, had altogether got ahead
      of him during the fight. As far as they had gone, they had stopped the
      fire, having made a black wilderness a mile and a half in length, which,
      during the whole distance, ceased suddenly at the line at which the
      subsidiary fire had been extinguished. But while the attack was being made
      upon them the flames had crept on to the southward, and had now got beyond
      their reach. It had seemed, however, that the mass of fire which had got
      away from them was small, and already the damp of the night was on the
      grass; and Harry felt himself justified in hoping not that there might be
      no loss, but that the loss might not be ruinous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medlicot consented to be taken back to Gangoil instead of to the mill.
      Perhaps he thought that Kate Daly might be a better nurse than his mother,
      or that the quiet of the sheep station might be better for him than the
      clatter of his own mill-wheels. It was midnight, and they had a ride of
      fourteen miles, which was hard enough upon a man with a broken collarbone.
      The whole party also was thoroughly fatigued. The work they had been doing
      was about as hard as could fall to a man&rsquo;s lot, and they had now
      been many hours without food. Before they started Mickey produced his
      flask, the contents of which were divided equally among them all,
      including Jacko.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were preparing to start home Medlicot explained that it had struck
      him by degrees that Heathcote might be right in regard to Nokes, and that
      he had determined to watch the man himself whenever he should leave the
      mill. On that Monday he had given up work somewhat earlier than usual,
      saying that, as the following day was Christmas, he should not come to the
      mill. From that time Medlicot and his foreman had watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, in answer to a question from Heathcote,
      &ldquo;I can swear that I saw him with the lighted torch in his hand, and
      that he placed it among the grass. There were two others from Boolabong
      with him, and they must have seen him too.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; HARRY HEATHCOTE RETURNS IN TRIUMPH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the fight was quite over, and Heathcote&rsquo;s party had returned to
      their horses, Medlicot for a few minutes was faint and sick, but he
      revived after a while, and declared himself able to sit on his horse.
      There was a difficulty in getting him up, but when there he made no
      further complaint. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, as he settled himself in
      his saddle, &ldquo;is my first Christmas-day in Australia. I landed early
      in January, and last year I was on my way home to fetch my mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much like an English Christmas,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor yet as in Hanover,&rdquo; said the German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cork you should go to, or Galway, bedad, if you want to
      see Christmas kep&rsquo; after the ould fashion,&rdquo; said Mickey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we used to do it pretty well in Cumberland,&rdquo; said
      Medlicot. &ldquo;There are things which can&rsquo;t be transplanted. They
      may have roast beef, and all that, but you should have cold weather to
      make you feel that it is Christmas indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do it as well as we can,&rdquo; Harry pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      seen a great pudding come into the room all afire&mdash;just to remind one
      of the old country&mdash;when it has been so hot that one could hardly
      bear a shirt on one&rsquo;s shoulders. But yet there&rsquo;s something in
      it. One likes to think of the old place, though one is so far away. How do
      you feel now? Does the jolting hurt you much? If your horse is rough,
      change with me. This fellow goes as smooth as a lady.&rdquo; Medlicot
      declared that the pain did not trouble him much. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d have
      ridden over us, only for you,&rdquo; continued Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said Jacko, who was very proud
      of his own part in the battle. &ldquo;I say, Mr. Medlicot, did you see Bos
      and his horse part company? You did, Mr. Harry. Didn&rsquo;t he fly like a
      bird, all in among the bushes! I owed Bos one; I did, my word! And now I&rsquo;ve
      paid him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;He was riding at me as hard as
      he could come. I can&rsquo;t understand Boscobel. Nokes is a sly, bad,
      slinking follow, whom I never liked. But I was always good to Bos; and
      when he cheated me, as he did, about his time, I never even threatened to
      stop his money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him of it too plain,&rdquo; said the German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did tell him&mdash;of course&mdash;as I should you. It has come
      to that now, that if a man robs you&mdash;your own man&mdash;you are not
      to dare to tell him of it! What would you think of me, Karl, if I were to
      find you out, and was to be afraid of speaking to you, lest you should
      turn against me and burn my fences?&rdquo; Karl Bender shrugged his
      shoulders, holding his reins up to his eyes. &ldquo;I know what you ought
      to think! And I wish that every man about Gangoil should be sure that I
      will always say what I think right. I don&rsquo;t know that I ever was
      hard upon any man. I try not to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said the Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to pick my words because men like Nokes and
      Boscobel have the power of injuring me. I&rsquo;m not going to truckle to
      rascals because I&rsquo;m afraid of them. I&rsquo;d sooner be burned out
      of house and home, and go and work on the wharves in Brisbane, than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! yes,&rdquo; said Jacko, &ldquo;and I too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the devil is to get ahead, he must, but I won&rsquo;t hold a
      candle to him. You fellows may tell every man about the place what I say.
      As long as I&rsquo;m master of Gangoil I&rsquo;ll be master; and when I
      come across a swindle I&rsquo;ll tell the man who does it he&rsquo;s a
      swindler. I told Bos to his face; but I didn&rsquo;t tell any body else,
      and I shouldn&rsquo;t if he&rsquo;d taken it right and mended his ways.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They all understood him very well&mdash;the German, the Irishman, Medlicot&rsquo;s
      foreman, Medlicot himself, and even Jacko; and though, no doubt, there was
      a feeling within the hearts of the men that Harry Heathcote was imperious,
      still they respected him, and they believed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The masther should be the masther, no doubt,&rdquo; said the
      Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man that is a man vill not sell hisself body and soul,&rdquo;
      said the German, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I want dominion over your soul, Karl Bender?&rdquo; asked the
      squatter, with energy. &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t, nor over your body,
      except so far as it suits you to sell your services. What you sell you
      part with readily&mdash;like a man; and it&rsquo;s not likely that you and
      I shall quarrel. But all this row about nothing can&rsquo;t be very
      pleasant to a man with a broken shoulder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to hear you,&rdquo; said Medlicot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always a
      good listener when men have something really to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ve something to say,&rdquo; cried Harry.
      &ldquo;There never was a man came to my house whom I&rsquo;d sooner see as
      a Christmas guest than yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thankee, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than I could have said yesterday with truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than you did say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by George! But you&rsquo;ve beat me now. When you&rsquo;re
      hard pressed for hands down yonder, you send for me, and see if I won&rsquo;t
      turn the mill for you, or hoe canes either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So &lsquo;ll I; my word! yes. Just for my rations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had by this time reacted the Gangoil fence, having taken the
      directest route for the house. But Harry, in doing this, had not been
      unmindful of the fire. Had Medlicot not been wounded, he would have taken
      the party somewhat out of the way, down southward, following the flames;
      but Medlicot&rsquo;s condition had made him feel that he would not be
      justified in doing so. Now, however, it occurred to him that he might as
      well ride a mile or two down the fence, and see what injury had been done.
      The escort of the men would be sufficient to take Medlicot to the station,
      and he would reach the place as soon as they. If the flames were still
      running ahead, he knew that he could not now stop then, but he could at
      least learn how the matter stood with him. If the worst came to the worst,
      he would not now lose more than three or four miles of fencing, and the
      grass off a corner of his run. Nevertheless, tired as he was, he could not
      bear the idea of going home without knowing the whole story. So he made
      his proposal. Medlicot, of course, made no objection. Each of the men
      offered to go with him, but he declined their services. &ldquo;There is
      nothing to do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and nobody to catch; and if the fire
      is burning, it must burn.&rdquo; So he went alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words that he had uttered among his men had not been lightly spoken.
      He had begun to perceive that life would be very hard to him in his
      present position, or perhaps altogether impossible, as long as he was at
      enmity with all those around him. Old squatters whom he knew, respectable
      men who had been in the colony before he was born, had advised him to be
      on good terms with the Brownbies. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t ask them to
      your house, or go to them, but just soft-sawder them when yon meet,&rdquo;
      an old gentleman had said to him. He certainly hadn&rsquo;t taken the old
      gentleman&rsquo;s advice, thinking that to &ldquo;soft-sawder&rdquo; so
      great a reprobate as Jerry Brownbie would be holding a candle to the
      devil. But his own plan had hardly answered. Well, he was sure, at any
      rate, of this&mdash;that he could do no good now by endeavoring to be
      civil to the Brownbies. He soon came to the place where the fire had
      reached his fence, and found that it had burned its way through, and that
      the flames were still continuing their onward course. The fence to the
      north, or rather to the northwestward&mdash;the point whence the wind was
      coming&mdash;stood firm at the spot at which the fire had struck it. Dry
      as the wood was, the flames had not traveled upward against the wind. But
      to the south the fire was traveling down the fence. To stop this he rode
      half a mile along the burning barrier till he had headed the flames, and
      then he pulled the bushes down and rolled away the logs, so as to stop the
      destruction. As regarded his fence, there was less than a mile of it
      destroyed, and that he could now leave in security, as the wind was
      blowing away from it. As for his grass, that must now take its chance. He
      could see the dark light of the low running fire; but there was no longer
      a mighty blaze, and he knew that the dew of the night was acting as his
      protector. The harm that had been as yet done was trifling, if only he
      could protect himself from further harm. After leaving the fire, he had
      still a ride of seven or eight miles through the gloom of the forest&mdash;all
      alone. Not only was he weary, but his horse was so tired that he could
      hardly get him to canter for a furlong. He regretted that he had not
      brought the boy with him, knowing well the service of companionship to a
      tired beast. He was used to such troubles, and could always tell himself
      that his back was broad enough to bear them; but his desolation among
      enemies oppressed him. Medlicot, however, was no longer an enemy. Then
      there came across his mind for the first time an idea that Medlicot might
      marry his sister-in-law, and become his fast friend. If he could have but
      one true friend, he thought that he could bear the enmity of all the
      Brownbies. Hitherto he had been entirely alone in his anxiety. It was
      between three and four when he reached Gangoil, and he found that the
      party of horsemen had just entered the yard before him. The sugar planter
      was so weak that he could hardly get off his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies were still watching when the cavalcade arrived, though it
      was then between three and four in the morning. It was Harry&rsquo;s
      custom on such occasions to ride up to the little gate close to the
      veranda, and there to hang his bridle till some one should take his horse
      away; but on this occasion he and the others rode into the yard. Seeing
      this, Mrs. Heathcote and her sister went through the house, and soon
      learned how things were. Mr. Medlicot, from the mill, had come with a bone
      broken, and it was their duty to nurse him till a doctor could be procured
      from Maryborough. Now Maryborough was thirty miles distant. Some one must
      be dispatched at once. Jacko volunteered, but in such a service Jacko was
      hardly to be trusted. He might fall asleep on his horse, and continue his
      slumbers on the ground. Mickey and the German both offered; but the men
      were so beaten by their work that Heathcote did not dare to take their
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Mary,&rdquo; he said to his wife,
      &ldquo;there is nothing for it but for me to go for Jackson.&rdquo;
      Jackson was the doctor. &ldquo;And I can see the police at the same time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go, Harry. Yon are so tired already you can
      hardly stand this moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some strong coffee&mdash;at once. You don&rsquo;t know what
      that man has done for us. I&rsquo;ll tell you all another time. I owe him
      more than a ride into Maryborough. I&rsquo;ll make the men get Yorkie up&rdquo;&mdash;Yorkie
      was a favorite horse he had&mdash;&ldquo;while you make the coffee; and I&rsquo;ll
      lead Colonel&rdquo;&mdash;Colonel was another horse, well esteemed at
      Gangoil. &ldquo;Jackson will come quicker on him than on any animal he can
      get at Maryborough.&rdquo; And so it was arranged, in spite of the wife&rsquo;s
      tears and entreaties. Harry had his coffee and some food, and started,
      with his two horses, for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature is so good to us that we are sometimes disposed to think we might
      have dispensed with art. In the bush, where doctors can not be had, bones
      will set themselves; and when doctors do come, but come slowly, the broken
      bones suit themselves to such tardiness. Medlicot was brought in and put
      to bed. Let the reader not be shocked to hear that Kate Daly&rsquo;s room
      was given up to him, as being best suited for a sick man&rsquo;s comfort,
      and the two ladies took it in turn to watch him. Mrs. Heathcote was, of
      course, the first, and remained with him till dawn. Then Kate crept to the
      door and asked whether she should relieve her sister. Medlicot was asleep,
      and it was agreed that Kate should remain in the veranda, and look in from
      time to time to see whether the wounded man required aught at her hands.
      She looked in very often, and then, at last, he was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Daly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I feel so ashamed of the trouble
      I&rsquo;m giving.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it. It is nothing. In the bush every body, of
      course, does any thing for every body.&rdquo; When the words were spoken
      she felt that they were not as complimentary as she would have wished.
      &ldquo;You were to have come to-day, you know, but we did not think you&rsquo;d
      come like this, did we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t go home instead of coming
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor will reach Gangoil sooner than he could the mill. You
      are better here, and we will send for Mrs. Medlicot as soon as the men
      have had a rest. How was it all, Mr. Medlicot? Harry says that there was a
      fight, and that you came in just at the nick of time, and that but for you
      all the run would have been burned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said so; only he went off so quickly, and was so busy with
      things, that we hardly understood him. Is it not dreadful that there
      should be such fighting? And then these horrid fires! You were in the
      middle of the fire, were you not?&rdquo; It suited Kate&rsquo;s feelings
      that Medlicot should be the hero of this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were lighting them in front to put them out behind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, while you were at work, these men from Boolabong came
      upon you. Oh, Mr. Medlicot, we shall be so very, very wretched if you are
      much hurt. My sister is so unhappy about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only my collar-bone, Miss Daly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is so dreadful.&rdquo; She was still thinking of the one
      word he had spoken when he had&mdash;well, not asked her for her love, but
      said that which between a young man and a young woman ought to mean the
      same thing. Perhaps it had meant nothing! She had heard that young men do
      say things which mean nothing. But to her, living in the solitude of
      Gangoil, the one word had been so much! Her heart had melted with absolute
      acknowledged love when the man had been brought through into the house
      with all the added attraction of a broken bone. While her sister had
      watched, she had retired&mdash;to rest, as Mary had said, but in truth to
      think of the chance which had brought her in this guise into familiar
      contact with the man she loved. And then, when she had crept up to take
      her place in watching him, she had almost felt that shame should restrain
      her. But was her duty; and, of course, a man with a collar-bone broken
      would not speak of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make your Christmas so sad for you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as for that, we mind nothing about it&mdash;for ourselves. We
      are never very gay here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are happy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, quite happy, except when Harry is disturbed by these
      troubles. I don&rsquo;t think any body has so many troubles as a squatter.
      It sometimes seems that all the world is against him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be allies now, at any rate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do so hope we shall,&rdquo; said Kate, putting her hands
      together in her energy, and then retreating from her energy with sad
      awkwardness when she remembered the personal application of her wish.
      &ldquo;That is, I mean you and Harry,&rdquo; she added, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not I and others besides Harry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so much to him to have a real friend. Things concern us, of
      course, only just as they concern him. Women are never of very much
      account, I think. Harry has to do every thing, and every thing ought to be
      done for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you spoil Harry among you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say so to Mary, or she will be fierce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether I shall ever have a wife to stand up for me in
      that way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate had no answer to make, but she thought that it would be his own fault
      if he did not have a wife to stand up for him thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been very lucky in his wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has, Mr. Medlicot; but you are moving about, and you
      ought to lie still. There! I hear the horses; that&rsquo;s the doctor. I
      do so hope he won&rsquo;t say that any thing very bad is the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up from her chair, which was close to his bed, and as she did
      so just touched his hand with hers. It was involuntary on her part, having
      come of instinct rather than will, and she withdrew herself instantly. The
      hand she had touched belonged to the arm that was not hurt, and he put it
      out after her, and caught her by the sleeve as she was retreating. &ldquo;Oh,
      Mr. Medlicot, you must not do that; you will hurt yourself if you move in
      that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she escaped, and left the room, and did not see him again till the
      doctor had gone from Gangoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bone had been broken simply as other bones are broken; it was now set,
      and the sufferer was, of course, told that he must rest. He had suggested
      that he should be taken home, and the Heathcotes had concurred with the
      doctor in asserting that no proposition could be more absurd. He had
      intended to eat his Christmas dinner at Gangoil, and he must now pass his
      entire Christmas there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sugar can go on very well for ten days,&rdquo; Harry had said.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over myself and see about the men, and I&rsquo;ll
      fetch your mother over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this, however, Mrs. Heathcote had demurred successfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      kill yourself, Harry, if you go on like this,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bender, therefore, was sent in the buggy for the old lady, and at last
      Harry Heathcote consented to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My belief is, I shall sleep for a week,&rdquo; he said, as he
      turned in. But he didn&rsquo;t begin his sleep quite at once. &ldquo;I am
      very glad I went into Maryborough,&rdquo; he said to his wife, rising up
      from his pillow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sworn an information against Nokes and
      two of the Brownbies, and the police will be after them this afternoon.
      They won&rsquo;t catch Nokes, and they can&rsquo;t convict the other
      fellows. But it will be something to clear the country of such a fellow,
      and something also to let them know that detection is possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do sleep now, dear.&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will; I mean to. But look here, Mary; if any of the police
      should come here, mind you wake me at once. And, Mary, look here; do you
      know I shouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if that fellow was to be making
      up to Kate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Heathcote, with some little inward chuckle at her husband&rsquo;s
      assumed quickness of apprehension, reminded herself that the same idea had
      occurred to her some time ago. Mrs. Heathcote gave her husband full credit
      for more than ordinary intelligence in reference to affairs appertaining
      to the breeding of sheep and the growing of wool, but she did not think
      highly of his discernment in such an affair as this. She herself had been
      much quicker. When she first saw Mr. Medlicot, she had felt it a godsend
      that such a man, with the look of a gentleman, and unmarried, should come
      into the neighborhood; and, in so feeling, her heart had been entirely
      with her sister. For herself it mattered nothing who came or did not come,
      or whether a man were a bachelor, or possessed of a wife and a dozen
      children. All that a girl had a right to want was a good husband. She was
      quite satisfied with her own lot in that respect, but she was anxious
      enough on behalf of Kate. And when a young man did come, who might make
      matters so pleasant for them, Harry quarreled with him because he was a
      free-selector. &ldquo;A free fiddle-stick!&rdquo; she had once said to
      Kate&mdash;not, however, communicating to her innocent sister the ambition
      which was already filling her own bosom. &ldquo;Harry does take things up
      so&mdash;as though people weren&rsquo;t to live, some in one way and some
      in another! As far as I can see, Mr. Medlicot is a very nice fellow.&rdquo;
      Kate had remarked that he was &ldquo;all very well,&rdquo; and nothing
      more had been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Heathcote, in spite of Harry&rsquo;s aversion, had formed her
      little project&mdash;a project which, if then declared, would have filled
      Harry with dismay. And now the young aristocrat, as he turned himself in
      his bed, made the suggestion to his wife as though it were all his own!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never like to think much of these things beforehand,&rdquo; she
      said, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about thinking,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but a
      girl might do worse. If it should come up, don&rsquo;t set yourself
      against it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, of course, will please herself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heathcote.
      &ldquo;Now do lie down and rest yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His rest, however, was not of long duration. As he had himself suggested,
      two policemen reached Gangoil at about three in the afternoon, on their
      way from Maryborough to Boolabong, in order that they might take Mr.
      Medlicot&rsquo;s deposition. After Heathcote&rsquo;s departure it had
      occurred to Sergeant Forrest of the police&mdash;and the suggestion,
      having been transferred from the sergeant to the stipendiary magistrate,
      was now produced with magisterial sanction&mdash;that, after all, there
      was no evidence against the Brownbies. They had simply interfered to
      prevent the burning of the grass on their own run, and who could say that
      they had committed any crime by doing so? If Medlicot had seen Nokes with
      a lighted branch in his hand, the matter might be different with him; and
      therefore Medlicot&rsquo;s deposition was taken. He had sworn that he had
      seen Nokes drag his lighted torch along the ground; he had also seen other
      horsemen&mdash;two or three, as he thought&mdash;but could not identify
      them. Jacko&rsquo;s deposition was also taken as to the man who had been
      heard and seen in the wool-shed at night. Jacko was ready to swear
      point-blank that the man was Nokes. The policemen suggested that, as the
      night was dark, Jacko might as well allow a shade of doubt to appear,
      thinking that the shade of doubt would add strength to the evidence. But
      Jacko was not going to be taught what sort of oath he should swear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see his leg move?
      You go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with these depositions, the two constables went on to Boolabong in
      search of Nokes, and of Nokes only, much to the chagrin of Harry, who
      declared that the police would never really bestir themselves in a
      squatter&rsquo;s cause. &ldquo;As for Nokes, he&rsquo;ll be out of
      Queensland by this time to-morrow.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; SERGEANT FORREST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Brownbie party returned, after their midnight raid, in great
      discomfiture to Boolabong. Their leader, Jerry, was burned about his hands
      and face in a disagreeable and unsightly manner. Joe had hardly made good
      that character for &ldquo;fighting it out to the end&rdquo; for which he
      was apt to claim credit. Boscobel was altogether disconcerted by his fall.
      And Nokes, who had certainly shown no aptitude for the fray, was abused by
      them all as having caused their retreat by his cowardice; while Sing Sing,
      the runaway cook, who knew that he had forfeited his wages at Gangoil, was
      forced to turn over in his heathenish mind the ill effects of joining the
      losing side. &ldquo;You big fool, Bos,&rdquo; he said more than once to
      his friend the woodsman, who had lured him away from the comforts of
      Gangoil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll punch your head, John, if you don&rsquo;t hold
      your row,&rdquo; Boscobel would reply. But Sing Sing went on with his
      reproaches, and, before they had reached Boolabong, Boscobel had punched
      the Chinaman&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not coming in here,&rdquo; Jerry said to Nokes, when
      they reached the yard gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wants to come in? I suppose you&rsquo;re not going to send a
      fellow on without a bit of grub after such a night&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him some bread and meat, Jack, and let him go on. There&rsquo;ll
      be somebody here after him before long. He can&rsquo;t hurt us; but I don&rsquo;t
      want people to think that we are so fond of him that we can&rsquo;t do
      without harboring him here. Georgie, you&rsquo;ll go too, if you take my
      advice. That young cur will send the police here as sure as my name is
      Brownbie, and, if they once get hold of you, they&rsquo;ll have a great
      many things to talk to you about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie grumbled when he heard this, but he knew that the advice given him
      was good, and he did not attempt to enter the house. So Nokes and he
      vanished, away into the bush together&mdash;as such men do vanish&mdash;wandering
      forth to live as the wild beasts live. It was still a dark night when they
      went, and the remainder of the party took themselves to their beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following afternoon they were lying about the house, sometimes
      sleeping, and sometimes waking up to smoke, when the two policemen, who
      had already been at Gangoil, appeared in the yard. These men were dressed
      in flat caps, with short blue jackets, hunting breeches, and long black
      boots&mdash;very unlike any policemen in the old country, and much more
      picturesque. They leisurely tied their horses up, as though they had been
      in the habit of making weekly visits to the place, and walked round to the
      veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Brownbie, and how are you?&rdquo; said the sergeant to
      the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the family was gracious, and declared himself to be pretty
      well, considering all things. He called the sergeant by his name, and
      asked the men whether they&rsquo;d take a bit of something to eat. Joe
      also was courteous, and, after a little delay in getting a key from his
      brother, brought out the jar of spirits, which, in the bush, is regarded
      as the best sign known of thorough good-breeding. The sergeant said that
      he didn&rsquo;t mind if he did; and the other man, of course, followed his
      officer&rsquo;s example.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far every thing was comfortable, and the constables seemed in no hurry
      to allude to disagreeable subjects. They condescended to eat a bit of cold
      meat before they proceeded to business. And at last the matter to be
      discussed was first introduced by one of the Brownbie family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard that there was a scrimmage here last
      night,&rdquo; said Joe. The Brownbie party present consisted of the old
      man, Joe and Jack Brownbie, and Boscobel, Jerry keeping himself in the
      background because of his disfigurement. The sergeant, as he swallowed his
      food, acknowledged that he had heard something about it. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
      what brings you here,&rdquo; continued Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothing wrong here,&rdquo; said old Brownbie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, Mr. Brownbie,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;I hope
      not. We haven&rsquo;t got any thing against you, at any rate.&rdquo;
      Sergeant Forrest was a graduate of Oxford, the son of an English
      clergyman, who, having his way to make in the world, had thought that an
      early fortune would be found in the colonies. He had come out, had failed,
      had suffered some very hard things, and now, at the age of thirty-five,
      enjoyed life thoroughly as a sergeant of the colonial police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got any thing against anybody here, I should
      think?&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to get them as begun it,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and
      them as ought to be took up, you&rsquo;ll go to Gangoil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Jack,&rdquo; said his brother. &ldquo;Sergeant
      Forrest knows where to go better than you can tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sergeant asked a string of questions as to the nature of the
      fight; who had been hurt; and how badly had any body been hurt; and what
      other harm had been done. The answers to all these questions were given
      with a fair amount of truth, except that the little circumstance of the
      origin of the fire was not explained. Both Boscobel and Joe had seen the
      torch put down, but it could hardly have been expected that they should
      have been explicit as to such a detail as that. Nor did they mention the
      names of either their brother George or Nokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was there in the matter?&rdquo; asked the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was young Heathcote, and a boy he has got there, and the two
      chaps as he calls boundary rulers, and Medlicot, the sugar fellow from the
      mill, and a chap of Medlicot&rsquo;s I never set eyes on before. They must
      have expected something to be up, or Heathcote would not have been going
      about at night with a tribe of men like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who were your party?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there were just ourselves, four of us, for Georgie was here,
      and this fellow Boscobel. Georgie never stays long, and he wouldn&rsquo;t
      be welcome if he did. He turned up just by chance like, and now he&rsquo;s
      off again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was all, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they all knew that the sergeant knew that Nokes had been with
      them. &ldquo;Well, then, that wasn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said old Brownbie.
      &ldquo;Bill Nokes was here, whom Heathcote dismissed ever so long ago, and
      that Chinese cook of his. He dismissed him too, I suppose. And he
      dismissed Boscobel here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can live at Gangoil any time,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Every
      body knows that. He wants to be lord a&rsquo;mighty over every thing. But
      he ain&rsquo;t going to be lord a&rsquo;mighty at Boolabong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he ain&rsquo;t going to burn our grass either,&rdquo; said Joe.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his impudence coming on to our ran and burning
      every thing before him. He calls hisself a magistrate, but he&rsquo;s not
      to do just as he pleases because he&rsquo;s a magistrate. I suppose we can
      swear against him for lighting our grass, sergeant? There isn&rsquo;t one
      of us that didn&rsquo;t see him do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is Nokes?&rdquo; asked the sergeant, paying no attention
      to the application made by Mr. Brownbie, junior, for redress to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;Nokes isn&rsquo;t any where about
      Boolabong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s away with your brother George?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a serious matter lighting a fire, you know,&rdquo; said
      the sergeant. &ldquo;A man would have to swing for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why isn&rsquo;t young Heathcote to swing?&rdquo; demanded
      Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is such a thing as intent, you know. When Heathcote lighted
      the fire, where would the fire have gone if he hadn&rsquo;t kept putting
      it out as fast as he kept lighting it? On to his own run, not to yours.
      And where would the other fire have gone which somebody lit, and which
      nobody put out, if he hadn&rsquo;t been there to stop it? The less you say
      against Heathcote the better. So Nokes is off, is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t here, anyways,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;When the row
      was over, we wouldn&rsquo;t let him in. We didn&rsquo;t want him about
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;Now let me go and
      see the spot where the fight was.&rdquo; So the two policemen, with the
      two young Brownbies, rode away, leaving Boscobel with the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows every thing about it,&rdquo; said old Brownbie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he do,&rdquo; said Boscobel, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t no odds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a ha&rsquo;porth of odds,&rdquo; said Jerry, coming out of his
      hiding-place. &ldquo;Who cares what he knows? A man may do what he pleases
      on his own run, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He mayn&rsquo;t light a fire as &lsquo;ll spread,&rdquo; said the
      old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother! Who&rsquo;s to prove what&rsquo;s in a man&rsquo;s mind? If
      I&rsquo;d been Nokes, I&rsquo;d have staid and seen it out. I&rsquo;d
      never be driven about the colony by such a fellow as Heathcote, with all
      the police in the world to back him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Forrest inspected the ground on which the fire had raged, and the
      spot on which the men had met; but nothing came of his inspection, and he
      had not expected that any thing would come of it. He could see exactly
      where the fire had commenced, and could trace the efforts that had been
      made to stop it. He did not in the least doubt the way in which it had
      been lit. But he did very much doubt whether a jury could find Nokes
      guilty, even if he could catch Nokes. Jacko&rsquo;s evidence was worth
      nothing, and Mr. Medlicot might be easily mistaken as to what he had seen
      at a distance in the middle of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this happened on Christmas-day. At about nine o&rsquo;clock the same
      evening the two constables re-appeared at Gangoil, and asked for
      hospitality for the night. This was a matter of course, and also the
      reproduction of the Christmas dinner. Mrs. Medlicot was now there, and her
      son, with his collar-bone set, had been allowed to come out on to the
      veranda. The house had already been supposed to be full, but room, as a
      matter of course, was made for Sergeant Forrest and his man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a queer sort of Christmas we&rsquo;ve all been having, Mr. Heathcote,&rdquo;
      said the sergeant, as the remnant of a real English plum-pudding was put
      between him and his man by Mrs. Growler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little hotter than it is at home, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is. You must have had it hot last night, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very hot, sergeant. We had to work uncommonly hard to do it as well
      as we did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not a nice Christmas game, Sir, was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Medlicot. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae
      Christmas games or ony games here at all, except just worrying and
      harrying, like sae many dogs at each other&rsquo;s throats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think nothing more can be done?&rdquo; Harry asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we shall catch the men. When they get out
      backward, it&rsquo;s very hard to trace them. He&rsquo;s got a horse of
      his own with him, and he&rsquo;ll be beyond reach of the police by this
      time to-morrow. Indeed, he&rsquo;s beyond their reach now. However, you&rsquo;ll
      have got rid of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are others as bad as he left behind. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      trust that fellow Boscobel a yard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t stir, Sir. He belongs to this country, and does not
      want to leave it. And when a thing has been tried like that and has
      failed, the fellows don&rsquo;t try it again. They are cowed like by their
      own failure. I don&rsquo;t think you need fear fire from the Boolabong
      side again this summer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the sergeant and his man discreetly allowed themselves to be
      put to bed in the back cottage; for in truth, when they arrived, things
      had come to such a pass at Gangoil that the two additional visitors were
      hardly welcome. But hospitality in the bush can be stayed by no such
      considerations as that. Let their employments or enjoyments on hand be
      what they may, every thing must yield to the entertainment of strangers.
      The two constables were in want of their Christmas dinner, and it was
      given to them with no grudging hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Nokes, we may say that he has never since appeared in the
      neighborhood of Gangoil, and that none thereabouts ever knew what was his
      fate. Men such as he wander away from one colony into the next, passing
      from one station to another, or sleeping on the ground, till they become
      as desolate and savage as solitary animals. And at last they die in the
      bush, creeping, we may suppose, into hidden nooks, as the beasts do when
      the hour of death comes on them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The constables had started from Gangoil, on their way to Boolabong, a
      little after four, and from that time till he was made to get out of bed
      for his dinner Harry Heathcote was allowed to sleep. He had richly earned
      his rest by his work, and he lay motionless, without a sound, in the broad
      daylight, with his arm under his head, dreaming, no doubt, of some happy
      squatting land, in which there were no free-selectors, no fires, no
      rebellious servants, no floods, no droughts, no wild dogs to worry the
      lambs, no grass seeds to get into the fleeces, and in which the price of
      wool stood steady at two shillings and sixpence a pound. His wife from
      time to time came into the room, shading the light from his eyes,
      protecting him from the flies, and administering in her soft way to what
      she thought might be his comforts. His sleep was of the kind which no
      light, nor even flies, can interrupt. Once or twice she stooped down and
      kissed his brow, but he was altogether unconscious of her caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time old Mrs. Medlicot arrived; but her coming did not awake
      the sleeper, though it was by no means made in silence. The old woman
      sobbed and cried over her son, at the same time expressing her
      thankfulness that he should have turned up in the forest so exactly at the
      proper moment, evidently taking part in the conviction that her Giles had
      saved Gangoil and all its sheep. And then there were all the necessary
      arrangements to be made for the night, in accordance with which almost
      every body had to give up his or her bed and sleep somewhere else. But
      nothing disturbed Harry. For the present he was allowed to occupy his own
      room, and he enjoyed the privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate Daly during this time was much disturbed in mind. The reader may
      remember&mdash;Kate, at any rate, remembered well&mdash;that, just as the
      doctor had arrived to set his broken bone, Mr. Medlicot, disabled as he
      was, had attempted to take her by the arm. He had certainly chosen an odd
      time for a declaration of love, just the moment in which he ought to have
      been preparing himself for the manipulation of his fractured limb; but,
      unless he had meant a declaration of love, surely he would not have seized
      her by the arm. It was a matter to her of great moment. Oh, of what vital
      importance! The English girl living in a town, or even in what we call the
      country, has no need to think of any special man till some special man
      thinks of her. Men are fairly plentiful, and if one man does not come,
      another will. And there have probably been men coming and going in some
      sort since the girl left her school-room and became a young lady. But in
      the bush the thing is very different. It may be that there is no young man
      available within fifty miles&mdash;no possible lover or future husband,
      unless Heaven should interfere almost with a miracle. To those to whom
      lovers are as plentiful as blackberries it may seem indelicate to surmise
      that the thought of such a want should ever enter a girl&rsquo;s head. I
      doubt whether the defined idea of any want had ever entered poor Kate&rsquo;s
      head. But now that the possible lover was there&mdash;not only possible,
      but very probable&mdash;and so eligible in many respects, living so close,
      with a house over his head and a good business; and then so handsome, and,
      as Kate thought, so complete a gentleman! Of course she turned it much in
      her mind. She was very happy with Harry Heathcote. There never was a
      brother-in-law so good! But, after all, what is a brother-in-law, though
      he be the very best? Kate had already begun to fancy that a house of her
      own and a husband of her own would be essential to her happiness. But then
      a man can not be expected to make an offer with a broken collar-bone&mdash;certainly
      can not do so just when the doctor has arrived to set the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late on in the day, when the doctor had gone, and Medlicot was, according
      to instructions, sitting out on the veranda in an armchair, and his mother
      was with him, and while Harry was sleeping as though he never meant to be
      awake again, Kate managed to say a few words to her sister. It will be
      understood that the ladies&rsquo; hands were by no means empty. The
      Christmas dinner was in course of preparation, and Sing Sing, that
      villainous Chinese cook, had absconded. Mrs. Growler, no doubt, did her
      best; but Mrs. Growler was old and slow, and the house was full of guests.
      It was by no means an idle time; but still Kate found an opportunity to
      say a word to her sister in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of him, Mary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the married sister &ldquo;him&rdquo; would naturally mean Harry
      Heathcote, of whom, as he lay asleep, the young wife thought that he was
      the very perfection of patriarchal pastoral manliness; but she knew enough
      of human nature to be aware that the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of the moment to
      her sister was no longer her own husband. &ldquo;I think he has got his
      arm broken fighting for Harry, and that we are bound to do the best we can
      for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; that&rsquo;s of course. I&rsquo;m sure Harry will feel
      that. He used, you know, to&mdash;to&mdash;that is, not just to like him,
      because he is a free-selector.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll drop all that now. Of course they could not be
      expected to know each other at the first starting. I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder if they became regular friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be nice! After all, though you may be so happy at home,
      it is better to have something like a neighbor. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on who the neighbors are. I don&rsquo;t care much for
      the Brownbies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are quite different, Mary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the Medlicots very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider he&rsquo;s quite a gentleman,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s a gentleman. Look here, Kate&mdash;I shall be
      ready to welcome Mr. Medlicot as a brother-in-law, if things should turn
      out that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, Mary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not? Well, you can mean it if you please, as far as I am
      concerned. Has he said any thing to you, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you call a word; not a word of that kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he meant it once&mdash;this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he meant it. And if he meant it this morning, he won&rsquo;t
      have forgotten his meaning to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why he should mean it, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in the least, Kate; is there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re laughing at me, Mary. I never used to laugh at you
      when Harry was coming. I was so glad, and I did every thing I could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you went away and left us in the Botanical Gardens. I
      remember. But, you see, there are no Botanical Gardens here; and the poor
      man couldn&rsquo;t walk about if there were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what Harry would say if it were to be so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;d be glad&mdash;for your sake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he does so despise free-selectors! And then he used to think
      that Mr. Medlicot was quite as bad as the Brownbies. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      marry any one to be despised by you and Harry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all gone by, my dear,&rdquo; said the wife, feeling
      that she had to apologize for her husband&rsquo;s prejudices. &ldquo;Of
      course one has to find out what people are before one takes them to one&rsquo;s
      bosom. Mr. Medlicot has acted in the most friendly way about these fires,
      and I&rsquo;m sure Harry will never despise him any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have done more for a real brother than have his
      arm broken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must remember one thing, Kate, Mr. Medlicot is very nice,
      and like a gentleman, and all that. Bat you never can be quite certain
      about any man till he speaks out plainly. Don&rsquo;t set your heart upon
      him till you are quite sure that he has set his upon you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Kate, giving her maidenly assurance when it was
      so much too late! Just at this moment Mrs. Growler came into the kitchen,
      and Kate&rsquo;s promises and her sister&rsquo;s cautions were for the
      moment silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How we&rsquo;re to manage to get the dinner on the table, I for one
      don&rsquo;t know at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Growler. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      Mr. Bates&rsquo;ll be here; that will be six of &rsquo;em; and that Mr.
      Medlicot will want somebody to do every thing for him, because he&rsquo;s
      been and got hisself smashed. And there&rsquo;s the old lady has just come
      out from home, and is as particular as any thing. And Mr. Harry himself
      never thinks of things at all. One pair of hands, and them very old, can&rsquo;t
      do every thing for every body.&rdquo; All of which was very well
      understood to mean nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Household deficiencies&mdash;and, indeed, all deficiencies&mdash;are
      considerable or insignificant in accordance with the aspirations of those
      concerned. When a man has a regiment of servants in his dining-room, with
      beautifully cut glass, a forest of flowers, and an iceberg in the middle
      of his table if the weather be hot, his guests will think themselves ill
      used and badly fed if aught in the banquet be astray. There must not be a
      rose leaf ruffled; a failure in the attendance, a falling off in a dish,
      or a fault in the wine is a crime. But the same guests shall be merry as
      the evening is long with a leg of mutton and whisky toddy, and will change
      their own plates, and clear their own table, and think nothing wrong, if
      from the beginning such has been the intention of the giver of the feast.
      In spite of Mrs. Growler&rsquo;s prognostications, though the cook had
      absconded, and the chief guest of the occasion could not cut up his own
      meat, that Christmas dinner at Gangoil was eaten with great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had been so far triumphant. He had stopped the fire that was
      intended to ruin him, he had beaten off his enemies on their own ground,
      and he was no longer oppressed by that sense of desolation which had
      almost overpowered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give one toast, Mrs. Medlicot,&rdquo; he said, when
      Mrs. Growler and Kate between them had taken away the relics of the
      plum-pudding. &ldquo;Our friends at home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady drank the toast with a sob. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s vera weel
      for you, Mr. Heathcote. You&rsquo;re young, and will win your way hame,
      and see auld friends again, nae doubt; but I&rsquo;ll never see ane of
      them mair, except those I have here.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the old lady ate
      her dinner and drank her toddy, and made much of the occasion, going in
      and out to her son upon the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after dinner Heathcote, as was his wont, strayed out with his prime
      minister Bates to consult on the dangers which might be supposed still to
      threaten his kingdom, and Mrs. Heathcote, with her youngest boy in her
      lap, sat talking to Mrs. Medlicot in the parlor. Such was not her custom
      in weather such as this. Kate had been sent out on to the veranda, with
      special commands to attend to the wants of the sufferer, and Mrs.
      Heathcote would have followed her had she not remembered her sister&rsquo;s
      appeal, &ldquo;I did every thing I could for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In those happy days Kate had been very good, and certainly deserved
      requital for her services. And therefore, when the men had gone out, Mrs.
      Heathcote, with her guest, remained in the warm room, and went so far as
      to suggest that at that period of the day the room was preferable to the
      veranda. Poor Mrs. Medlicot was new to the ways of the bush, and fell into
      the trap; thus Kate Daly was left alone with her wounded hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      When told to take him out his glass of wine, and when conscious that no
      one followed her, she felt herself to have been guilty of some great sin,
      and was almost tempted to escape. She had asked her sister for help; and
      this was the help that was forth-coming&mdash;help so palpable, so
      manifest, as to be almost indelicate! Would he think that plans were being
      made to catch him, now that he was a captive and impotent? The thought
      that it was possible that such an idea might occur to him was terrible to
      her. She would rather lose him altogether than feel the stain of such a
      suggestion on her own conscience. She put the glass of wine down on the
      little table by his side, and then attempted to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a moment with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where are they all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary and your mother are inside. Harry and Mr. Bates have gone
      across to look at the horses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost feel as though I could walk, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think of it yet, Mr. Medlicot. It seems almost a
      wonder that you shouldn&rsquo;t have to be in bed, and you with your
      collar-bone broken only last night! I don&rsquo;t know how you can bear it
      as you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be so glad I broke it, if one thing will come about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; asked Kate, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate&mdash;may I call you Kate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I love you, do you not? You must know it. Dearest Kate,
      can you love me and be my wife?&rdquo; His left arm was bound up, and was
      in a sling, but he put out his right hand to take hers, if she would give
      it to him. Kate Daly had never had a lover before, and felt the occasion
      to be trying. She had no doubt about the matter. If it were only proper
      for her to declare herself, she could swear with a safe conscience that
      she loved him better than all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your hand here, Kate,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the request was not exactly for the gift of her hand, she placed it in
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I keep it now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could only whisper something which was quite inaudible, even to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep it, and think that you are all my own. Stoop down,
      Kate, and kiss me, if you love me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment, trying to collect her thoughts. She did love
      him, and was his own; still, to stoop and kiss a man who, if such a thing
      were to be allowed at all, ought certainly to kiss her! She did not think
      she could do that. But then she was bound to protect him, wounded and
      broken as he was, from his own imprudence; and if she did not stoop to
      him, he would rise to her. She was still in doubt, still standing with her
      hand in his, half bending over him, but yet half resisting as she bent,
      when, all suddenly, Harry Heathcote was on the veranda, followed by the
      two policemen, who had just returned from Boolabong. She was sure that
      Harry had seen her, and was by no means sure that she had been quick
      enough in escaping from her lover&rsquo;s hand to have been unnoticed by
      the policemen also. She fled away as though guilty, and could hardly
      recover herself sufficiently to assist Mrs. Growler in producing the
      additional dinner which was required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men were quickly sent to their rest, as has been told before; and
      Harry, who had in truth seen how close to his friend his sister-in-law had
      been standing, would, had it been possible, have restored the lovers to
      their old positions; but they were all now on the veranda, and it was
      impossible. Kate hung back, half in and half out of the sitting-room, and
      old Mrs. Medlicot had seated herself close to her son. Harry was lying at
      full length on a rug, and his wife was sitting over him. Then Giles
      Medlicot, who was not quite contented with the present condition of
      affairs, made a little speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Heathcote,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have asked your sister to
      marry me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearie me, Giles,&rdquo; said Mrs. Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate remained no longer half in and half out of the parlor, but retreated
      altogether and hid herself. Harry turned himself over on the rug, and
      looked up at his wife, claiming infinite credit in that he had foreseen
      that such a thing might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what answer has she given you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Heathcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t given me any answer yet. I wonder what you and
      Heathcote would say about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Kate has to say is much more important,&rdquo; replied the
      discreet sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it of all things,&rdquo; said Harry, jumping up.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always best to be open about these things. When you
      first came here, I didn&rsquo;t like you. You took a bit of my river
      frontage&mdash;not that it does me any great harm&mdash;and then I was
      angry about that scoundrel Nokes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wrong about Nokes,&rdquo; said Medlicot, &ldquo;and have,
      therefore, had my collar-bone broken. As to the land, you&rsquo;ll forgive
      my having it if Kate will come and live there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George! I should think so.&mdash;Kate, why don&rsquo;t you come
      out? Come along, my girl. Medlicot has spoken out openly, and you should
      answer him in the same fashion.&rdquo; So saying, he dragged her forth,
      and I fear that, as far as she was concerned, something of the sweetness
      of her courtship was lost by the publicity with which she was forced to
      confess her love. &ldquo;Will you go, Kate, and make sugar down at the
      mill? I have often thought how bad it would be for Mary and me when you
      were taken away; but we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t mind it so much if we knew
      that you are to be near us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to him, Kate,&rdquo; said Mrs. Heathcote, with her arm round
      her sister&rsquo;s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s minded to have him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Medlicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Kate&mdash;shall it be so?&rdquo; pleaded the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up to him and leaned over him, and whispered one word which
      nobody else heard. But they all knew what the word was. And before they
      separated for the night she was left alone with him, and he got the kiss
      for which he was asking when the policemen interrupted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call a happy Christmas,&rdquo; said Harry, as
      the party finally parted for the night.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
